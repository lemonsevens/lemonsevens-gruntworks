  *   *   * 

We want to be your partner for your marketing efforts, but more than that, we want to help you evolve.
  * Evolve past non-specialized marketing agencies who don’t live and breathe home services.
  * Evolve past not getting clarity on the best strategies for home service marketing.


In this guide, we’re going to share , 3 important keys to a successful lead-generating website, how to take control of your own social media and video marketing, 3 crucial tactics for , and 3 killer tips for getting more out of your Google ad campaigns.
You may want to skip straight to paying an outside marketing company to do everything for you. We believe that could be a mistake.
First of all, you want to , and some marketing agencies don’t let you do that. Second of all, even when you outsource parts of your marketing strategy, you still want to act as the ‘general contractor’ for your marketing efforts, running point on tactics. No one cares more than you do about the lead flow for your company.
Here are our for maximizing your marketing in 2023:
  1. and fill it out completely.
  2. across all platforms, and set up social pages that look professional. Share on your personal social channels that you’d love to help!
  3. – short videos, how-to’s, and answers to common questions. It doesn’t have to be fancy, just useful and authentic.
  4. and get listed on every local directory you can, but keep your name, address, and phone number consistent.
  5. with bold, memorable designs that focus on making your company name stick in people’s minds.
  6. where you’re establishing a stronghold (door-knocking, direct mail – expand your base of power!).
  7. **Treat every customer like they will refer you 5 times** and constantly follow up with everyone who has contacted you (email marketing is a great way to do this).
  8. to be more aggressive.
  9. with other home service businesses, realtors, and insurance agents.
  10. , and use social media and content to attract great referral partners.


marketing is not what most marketing agencies are used to…
  * **Home services marketing is best when your marketing agency lives and breathes it,** and everything they do is dedicated to getting more leads.


Work with a marketing agency that specializes in and other home service companies! Many marketing agencies handle marketing for 20 different types of clients, but we believe it’s best to get an agency that understands in and out and is constantly learning. For example:
  * Every single Google ad we write is targeted at homeowners.
  * Every single blog post we optimize is to generate leads for home service businesses.
  * Every single website element we create is intended to be persuasive for homeowners.


In digital marketing, by which potential customers judge you, and all the rest of the components will live or die based on its effectiveness. Any business that neglects their website will spend way more money on every type of marketing they do.
Instead, take the time to of your business website to win more business, more easily, every time.
Your business lives and dies by what your customers say about you. One particularly powerful way to is by working the key themes you’re seeing in your reviews into your headlines and website copy.
Besides this, of course, you should feature direct quotes, photos of happy customers, and videos whenever possible. Always make your website headlines focused on the customer and their problems, not your company. This one powerful switch could transform your marketing strategy into a powerhouse.
marketing isn’t generally considered sexy. People aren’t trying to explore 20 pages on your site before calling you or submitting a service request. That’s why we believe the (CTA) should be front and center and grab as much attention as possible.
This may seem a bit pushy in some industries, but in marketing, it’s exactly what potential customers want. They want it to be and . We achieve this by featuring the full form right away on every selling page. Some businesses make the mistake of directing users to a second page before allowing them to contact the business. But as a homeowner, I want it to be as simple and easy as possible.
companies that want to attract as many local customers as possible through search engines should utilize so they have plenty of bait out on the internet to attract potential customers as part of their search engine optimization strategy.
  * Creating deep enough web pages so search engines can actually understand what each page is about.
  * Including the right local schema and meta data for local SEO to capture local searches.
  * Developing individual pages for each of their home services, and ensuring easy navigation with minimal clicks to access each one. This helps potential customers get the information they need quickly.


Keep in mind this is just the beginning. You must also include the basics, like listing your licensing and insurance information if required by law in your area for home service businesses.
Not every marketing tactic makes sense for an agency to handle. We believe it’s very difficult for an outside agency to do social media better than you can internally. 
Here’s the low-down on how to get the most out of your social media marketing.
So much of what makes business social media fresh and relevant is:
  * On-the-fly photos of the team, customer wins, and before-and-after photos of real jobs.
  * Behind-the-scenes content of the team or problems encountered on real jobs.


When we used to manage social media for clients, we found that the extra step of clients uploading pictures and videos to Google Drive, and us then downloading and posting them to social media, wasn’t adding as much value as we’d hoped. We strongly suggest taking this component of your marketing strategy .
Here are that can provide consistent content for your business:
  1. – Share challenges related to your niche or specific jobs. Homeowners love transparency.
  2. – Tell the story of a job, making the homeowner the hero. Visual evidence is powerful!
  3. – Post photos of your team members in their element, and explain why they’re awesome. People love stories about real people.
  4. – This not only builds goodwill but also creates referral partnerships.
  5. – If you’re running Google Local Services Ads, Google Guaranteed, or have any certifications (e.g., BBB, Angie Super Service), share the badges along with your logo. Always bring attention to third-party verification of your services. “Don’t take it from us!”
  6. – If something goes wrong on a job, don’t cover it up! Make a video showing how you fixed it. These videos are a great way to demonstrate your commitment to quality.
  7. – Remember: “People won’t remember what you said, but they’ll remember how you made them feel.” Use social media to inspire your audience and leave a lasting impact.


Creating video content doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s how you can easily generate video content that actually helps drive sales.
Write down the last 10 objections customers had about working with your company.What were their concerns, and how did you address them?
During your sales process, what questions do your potential customers frequently ask? These can be related to anything from the timeline to the quality of work.
Many home service businesses shy away from addressing pricing upfront, but it’s important to demystify the process. Answer questions about cost, why you may be more expensive than competitors, and anything else that reduces anxiety for your ideal customer.
Now, make videos addressing every single one of those topics!
Customers don’t want fluffy content from home service providers. They want information about the issues that concern them. The reason making these types of videos will likely make you more money than other marketing strategies is that customers are searching for transparency and practical advice.
The funny thing is, sharing this kind of content on your social media pages can also help your website rank higher on search engines if you turn it into blog posts. By tackling the hard stuff in your marketing strategies—the topics most home service professionals are afraid to touch—you’ll see a positive impact on your .
Do you want more prospective customers to find you in search results? As Tommy Mello says, “Google is God when it comes to ,” especially when it comes to digital marketing! Search engines in 2023 demand more than just business listings, content marketing, and 20-30 reviews to let you show up at the top of local search results. The bar has been raised significantly.
Gone are the days when you could throw out a 200-300 word blog and expect results. According to HubSpot, **91% of all blogs on the internet have 0 traffic.**
  * : Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMRush to find out what people are actually searching for. For example, if you guess that people are searching for “Home Services Marketing Important,” you can take the top-ranking page’s URL, plug it into Ahrefs, and discover which keywords it’s ranking for with high search volumes.
  * : Once you’ve found your target keywords, optimize your blog posts or web pages accordingly. Tools like Surfer SEO can help you analyze the top results for a specific term and guide you to include keywords, topics, or images more frequently to “beat” the current top-ranking pages.


All of this is part of , which is now a crucial component of internet marketing.
Google is a great search engine because it mastered the art of crawling the web and analyzing backlinks. A backlink is essentially any link on any webpage that directs you to another page, whether on the same site or a different one.
  * At first, Google would rank websites higher based on the number of links they had.
  * But as people gamed the system, Google introduced “PageRank,” making links from important websites count for much more than lesser-known sites.


Now, getting links from reputable websites has become a significant part of the , especially in the industry. Many companies skip this part of digital marketing and instead focus on paid ads, online reviews, and great customer service. But even with all that, without solid backlinks, these companies won’t show up in as many organic search results as they deserve.
  * **Do you provide enough information about each service for them to make an informed decision?**
  * **Do you have city landing pages for each of the cities you serve, so local customers can find you through Google search?**


These are just a few of the things that make up good and for a home service business. At Hook Agency, we build these elements into every website we create for our clients. By addressing these aspects, your site will be more visible on search engines, making your marketing strategies more effective.
Google Ads can be an incredibly effective tool when used correctly. Here’s how to get more out of your ad campaigns.
let Google auto-apply recommendations on your account. Go into your settings and turn this feature off immediately. There’s a fine line between letting Google help you optimize and allowing it to spend your budget on things that won’t generate customers. Your Google ads will perform much better when you have someone regularly monitoring them to stop unnecessary spending.
You should have separate campaigns for each service you provide. This allows Google’s AI to use conversion data to prioritize the headlines and elements that are working best. That’s why it’s important to provide as many headline options and variations as possible. Let Google’s multivariate testing work its magic.
If this is getting too complex, don’t worry! That’s why your business may benefit from having a specialized marketing agency like Hook Agency take this off your plate. We learn from all our other clients and apply those lessons to your ads.
Many home service businesses don’t put enough budget into each campaign. If your campaigns have less than $50 or even $30 a day, you won’t gather enough data to allow Google to optimize your spending.
Additionally, some flexibility on targeting can help Google’s optimization tools, but you want to set the foundation for success from the start. This is where having a partner who lives on these platforms daily can make a difference. Finally, regularly adding negative keywords is crucial to avoid wasting money on irrelevant searches.
A huge mistake is sending prospective customers to your home page instead of a that matches the ad they clicked. You will get more phone calls and leads if your landing pages are optimized and directly relevant to the service the customer is interested in. In fact, you should spend as much on your landing pages as you do on your ad spend over a couple of months.
Also, if you haven’t tried Google Local Services Ads yet, do so before hiring a marketing agency.
  * Utilize videos and other social media platforms to make satisfied customers the hero of the story.
  * Collaborate with influencers and referral partners to create engaging video content.
  * Leverage offline avenues like iconic branding, truck or van wraps, and job site branding.
  * Identify 3-5 core themes to hammer over and over again in your messaging. For example: 
  * Create a weekly checklist for your marketing manager to clarify expected activities and their rhythm.
  * Build a strong connection with a home services marketing agency that understands how to leverage custom websites, SEO, and content marketing to generate leads.
  * Push for more reviews on all marketing channels and utilize them in your website and paid advertising.

We take the time to steadily attract the right customers and make sure that your money is being used in the right places giving you the best results for your dollar.
A lot of people will go with the “all-in” approach, which does not necessarily give you the results you want, and could be a giant waste of money if it doesn’t work out. We find what’s working and what isn’t and expand on the parts that are working for your business goals.
##### What is remarketing – and why do you love it so much?
We believe if someone comes to your website – that they should see your company all around after they leave. The reason we love remarketing so much is that you pay pennies on the dollar for remarketing click-through, and 2nd and 3rd time visitors are much more likely to convert. In fact, people may take 6-8 times coming back to your website before they become a customer. Once you understand this dynamic, remarketing (sometimes known as retargeting) becomes much more obvious. We love how effective this is for many of our PPC clients, and how it increases their brand awareness as well.
PPC campaigns like Google AdWords are powerful tools to have in your marketing kit. Statistically, every dollar spent on a PPC comes back to you as $2.
If you’ve been using AdWords for your PPC campaign, you’ve probably encountered extensions. These are the little add-ons that allow you to beef up your text-only ad with a phone number, user reviews, or some additional links.
The obvious benefit of these is that they make your ad bigger. But is that always a good enough reason to use extensions? The different kinds of ad extensions are many and varied. But which ones are right for you?
The sitelink extension allows you to place additional links at the bottom of your ad.
The advantage of these additional links is that they can take your customer directly to a landing page that speaks to their needs. This could cut out a step in the conversion process and make them more likely to buy.
Make sure that your sales process is carefully mapped, and that each landing page has a specific place within it. Optimize your landing pages so when the customer arrives, they know exactly what to do next. They should be only a few simple clicks away from buying.
This of course adds your phone number. Is your phone number critical to your business? If you’re a small bookstore, for example, and 9 out of ten calls are asking about your hours, consider just posting your hours instead.
But if the old fashioned landline is one of the ways you funnel in clients, get your number out there! Google doesn’t charge you for a click when users dial it! Unless, that is, you opt in for Google to track your calls. In that case, they’ll replace your number with a Google forwarding number. Your phone will still ring, but Google will be able to send you analytics, including which keyword produced the call. In this case, each call costs the average of one click.
This shows a pin with your address that links to a Google map. It’s a handy way to show your customers that you’re in their neighborhood. But like a landline, this could work against you depending on the nature of your business.
Consider that if you are an online service, or a service that makes house calls (food delivery, pest control, etc.) listing your location isn’t a good idea. It implies that the customer has to come to you, and they might skim over your ad for that reason. Use a location extension if you are a neighborhood brick and mortar, and your business depends on in person foot traffic. A beauty salon is a good example of this. If you’re an online business, like a translation services provider, keep your ad directed to your website. Don’t make it confusing by adding your office location–especially if it’s a home office!
If you want to show off some good reviews from a third-party source, try the review extension. These add a little quote, or sometimes a paraphrasing, of your amazing review to your text ad. But be forewarned: Google has stringent criteria for these. Most of them end up getting removed because Google finds them to be fabricated by the business owner. So don’t try to fake it! An authentic review extension can lend authority and trustworthiness to your brand before the user even clicks.
These are only a few of the many extensions available to Google AdWords users. While they are among the most popular, it’s worth taking the time to explore all of the options to decide which do–and do not–work for your company’s campaign. As with anything PPC, the trick is to tailor an ad the way you like it, test it for performance, and then adjust it again. You never know which extensions are going to bring you the greatest return, so be flexible, and be smart. They aren’t all going to work for you, but they are very fun to test drive!
PPC and SEO are both focused on getting in front of people on search engines. PPC means you pay Google (or Bing) to be shown towards the top – and SEO means you try to make tweaks to your site and content to get shown higher in the unpaid results.
We strongly suggest a campaign that includes both elements, as our absolute ideal is to be shown 4 times on the first page for a company’s top money-making keywords. (Once in the top ads, the top map ad, in the organic map results, and ideally #1 in the organic results as well.)
Because many people skip the ads – we believe if you have to choose only one strategy, you should spend money on Search Engine Optimization first, but it does depend on your unique situation and needs.
While it is a tempting thought that throwing in lots of money really fast will get you really fast results, it is not always true. We like to take a slower approach to make sure you are getting in front of the right audience and get results.
We then trim off the parts that are not performing and expanding the areas that are performing well for your business. This gives you a truly customized campaign that benefits your company. This way, you are able to get the best results.

Get started today and ensure that when customers search for your services, they find YOU at the top.
##### How does Google determine which businesses appear at the top of Local Services Ads?
Google ranks businesses in Local Services Ads (LSAs) based on three main factors:


Proximity to the searcher also plays a role. Businesses with faster response times and higher review scores are more likely to appear at the top. A study by BrightLocal shows that 87% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses, making reviews a critical factor in visibility.
##### What factors influence the cost-per-lead for Local Services Ads, and how can we lower it over time?



According to Google, advertisers who respond within an hour are 60% more likely to convert leads into paying customers.
##### Can you help manage reviews directly on LSA to improve visibility and lead generation?
Yes, managing reviews is essential for boosting your LSA visibility. Hook Agency helps businesses:


Google prioritizes businesses with high ratings, as 93% of buyers say reviews influence their purchase decisions.
##### What happens if I receive a bad review through LSA – how does it impact my ad performance?
A few negative reviews won’t derail your performance if your overall rating remains high. However, consistent negative feedback can lower your ranking. To minimize the impact:
  * Request more reviews from satisfied clients to offset the negative ones


Google’s algorithm tends to reward businesses that actively engage with reviewers. According to ReviewTrackers, businesses that reply to at least 25% of reviews average 35% more revenue.
##### How do Local Services Ads integrate with regular Google Ads?
Local Services Ads (LSAs) focus on direct leads, while Google Ads drive broader awareness and website traffic. Running both can maximize reach:


Google reports that businesses using LSAs see an average increase of 14% in direct bookings compared to those relying solely on traditional search ads.

## Changing our clients lives by taking stuff off their plate, and getting you more leads
We’ve partnered with the top 5% of plumbing companies for a reason – we know it takes significant effort to dominate Google, and it’s not for the faint of heart. One of the hardest parts about driving leads from digital marketing – is sticking with it, until your investment compounds, and you kick yourself that you didn’t start sooner.
  * We do keyword research with best in class digital marketing tools to figure out what your competitors are ranking for, and what the most people are searching in your area. “Plumbers near me” is only the beginning – we can tell you the suburbs and the most lucrative terms based on ‘search volume.’

  * Our writers (who write for other contractors) extract key information about how you operate and then write useful articles, and ‘landing pages’ to attract people in.


Beyond these things we do so much more – including getting links back to your website from around the web (huge for Google rankings,) and report on a monthly basis, with a live marketing dashboards. We show the increase year over year for traffic, leads, and phone calls.

"Our company was working with a different marketing agency for a couple years, before making the decision to switch. Hook built us a beautiful new website and is running our SEO & Google Ads.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.








Our biggest thing is that we know how web design + SEO combine to get you more leads. Many plumbing marketing + lead generation companies focus on one or the other.
  * We exclusively serve contractors and home service providers and all of our systems are optimized for these industries.


Our timeline on websites is right around 100 days where we do a fully custom design and development of the site so that it is made specifically for your company. There are several companies that are out there using a different approach with their business by using WordPress themes or just by taking the easy road and not doing necessary steps to make the process move faster. When you work with these types of companies, they may be cheaper, but that’s because there is less effort going into it and you’ll probably end up coming to us again later to get things right.
##### How long does it take for SEO to get results?
SEO is not something that takes off overnight – it is actually a process that takes around 3 to 6 months to see clear results so you see that things are working well. There will be another stage at the 6 to 9-month mark where you will see your ROI to be seen and will also have a pretty sizable increase in the number of leads you have.

A couple things to note here: websites that are more complex can be more expensive – up to 50k. Our PPC management fee goes up as you spend more on ads, and there’s more to manage. **Yes! We’re more expensive than many companies. Read the FAQ’s below the pricing for more information on why we may be more expensive than many companies.**


##### Why are Hook Agency’s websites more expensive / what’s different about your websites?
Our big difference in our websites is that we know keys to SEO and it’s about structure + having the right content in places. We also know what makes an effective contractor websites with years of analytics and 50+ contractors.
  * Our websites are completely custom. (many companies use cheap + generic templates.)

  * We have context on the construction + home service industry and it helps us ask the right questions in the discovery kickoff.


Our websites use the ‘Winning Website Formula’ – built off of years of A/B testing, ‘user testing’ and monitoring analytics to push up increases in leads on contractors websites:
  * Emotionally persuasive images and headlines (Make your ideal customer the hero + help them imagine themselves working with you).
  * Really clear ‘differentiating features’/’unique value propositions’ – what can your competitors NOT say?


Not to mention, our websites are really good looking! Check out our page for design inspiration.
People like our transparency w/ clear documentation of deliverables every month (content written, links acquired, technical changes made) and that we are consistently aggressive. We also have a monthly reporting dashboard – to give you full transparency over key metrics, and report on them in a monthly video call.
##### Why is Hook better at Paid Ad management than many companies?
We keep budgets tight, we have a copywriter on ads and we focus on eliminating waste and most importantly 
For SEO + PPC we look at leads with you, as they start to increase and focus on pushing where your best leads are coming from.

We’re proud to share the positive feedback and testimonials we've received from our clients in the industry. Their kind words reflect our commitment to driving results and improving businesses together. 
"Our company was working with a different marketing agency for a couple years, before making the decision to switch. Hook built us a beautiful new website and is running our SEO & Google Ads. It has only been 3 months & the difference is unimaginable. We have never had this much traffic & quality lead flow in 30+ years of business. Our metrics are exceeding our expectations & we cannot wait to see our continued growth with Hook."
"Hook Agency is the epitome of professionalism in a marketing agency. I own an 8 figure roofing business and marketing is one of the most vital parts to my business. Hook had built me a 5 star website, easy to use, attractive and most importantly it converts! They also manage all my google ads and bring in an insanely good ROI. Can’t say enough good things, this is a premier marketing company who gets it right where few do!"
"Hook has been an excellent partner for Aquarius. Not only have we had excellent results in the very competitive world of SEO and PPC for HVAC, plumbing and electrical, we get excellent service from their team, particularly our main contacts Cody Warren and Skyler McDaniel. Their team are knowledgeable, creative, thorough, accountable, and detail oriented. You can tell this is an organization that cares about the right things and I highly recommend them."
"Hook has been an absolute game-changer for our business! Their marketing team combines creativity with strategic thinking, resulting in campaigns that truly resonate with our audience. And let’s talk about Claudia—our superstar account representative! She’s not just knowledgeable; she’s also incredibly personable. Claudia’s attention to detail and commitment to our success make her an invaluable asset. If you’re looking for a marketing partner that delivers results, look no further than Hook!"
"Hook redesigned my companies website, they are consummate pros and it came out fantastic. Being in the roofing industry it can be difficult to explain nuances to website designers. With Hook, they knew the language and the industry like the back of their hand. Maggie and Claudia have been essential to my companies success! Also running PPC with them."
"Working with Claudia, Maggie, Dillon and the entire Hook team has been such an easy experience. Hook sets the bar very high in all aspects of their operation. I would highly recommend anyone that is serious about growing their business to check them out!"
"Hook Agency has been a pleasure to work with. Everyone that we work with is smart, focused and serious about their work. Hiring Hook has given me peace around our lead generation. We are getting quality leads on a consistent basis in the areas of the city that we are specifically targeting. Hook is forward thinking and data driven. It's worth the cost."
"It has been a pleasure to work with the entire Hook team and especially our Account Manager, Vinny! He has coached us at Clean Cut in best practices for our SEO and PPC and helped us navigate the murky world of marketing with clear data that leaves us confident that Hook is the right partner for us. Thank you Vinny and thank you Hook Agency!"
"I can't speak highly enough of everyone at Hook! They built our website from scratch and were so incredibly thorough and detailed with the entire process. They also run our SEO and that same level of care and attention to detail pours out of each of them. Everyone at Hook, from top to bottom has been so incredible to work with! We cannot thank them enough for all they have done and promise you will not regret it either!"
"Our company was working with a different marketing agency for a couple years, before making the decision to switch. Hook built us a beautiful new website and is running our SEO & Google Ads.

We’ve helped many home service businesses get more & better leads by turning their website into a lead magnet. We’re also constantly learning from contractor-focused consultants & software companies to be more effective for our clients.
Of course, you wouldn’t pay for this service if it wasn’t really going to make a difference for your business. But we are confident that our strategies get results; we’ve been doing this for years, and we’ve seen fireplace companies double or even triple their leads time and time again.
Nobody reads ads that aren’t visually appealing. Since visual elements are key aspects of advertising, especially PPC campaigns, we don’t upcharge for the ad designs. Instead, we include ad design in your initial fee package.
If you also desire landing pages, you have the option to add them separately at any stage of the process. Our team can design custom landing pages that fit with your campaign.
These days, many of the searches that are being done are coming from things such as mobile devices and tablets. Right around 50 percent to be precise.
This means that if you don’t have a mobile-friendly device, you could be missing out on 50 percent of the potential customers that are out there because they aren’t able to navigate your site.
Our website design always makes this a priority because we know how important it is.
While it is a tempting thought that throwing in lots of money really fast will get you really fast results, it is not always true. We like to take a slower approach to make sure you are getting in front of the right audience and get results.
We then trim off the parts that are not performing and expanding the areas that are performing well for your business. This gives you a truly customized campaign that benefits your company. This way, you are able to get the best results.
works by modifying elements on a website like the meta title and meta description of a page to ‘optimize’ it to get the most possible traffic. ‘Keyword targeting’ can determine which words you should be aiming for, and getting links from other high authority sites and creating relevant content on your web page and via articles on your site can shift your website up in search rankings over time.
This is different from PPC / as they are usually above the organic listing, and have a little ad identifier next to them (where 80% of people skip them, they still can drive powerful revenue.)

In today’s competitive home services landscape, you deserve a marketing agency that truly prioritizes your success and understands the unique challenges of your industry. At our agency, we are committed to developing tailored SEO strategies that not only enhance your online presence but also focus on generating more and better leads for your business.
We believe in building genuine partnerships with our clients, taking the time to understand your goals, values, and target audience. Our dedicated team is here to provide support, transparency, and ongoing communication, ensuring that you feel valued and confident in our collaborative efforts to drive your business forward.
#### **How Long Does SEO + PPC Take To Get Leads?**
We understand that choosing a marketing agency is tough. In this video, we answer some of the most frequently asked questions surrounding the lead generation timeline through SEO and PPC. We want to be your partner for your home services marketing efforts, but more than that we want to help you evolve.
“Just understand Google is God when it comes to home service.” – Tommy Mello, A1 Garage Door Services
  * SEO in general, is one of the most powerful marketing systems and often can result in ROI of over 200%. 
  * Our average client gets over double the leads year over year from Google traffic 
  * We have 60+ 5-star reviews and 7 in-depth case studies. Our founder and lead strategist has been referenced by industry experts Larry Kim, Jeff Bullas, Neil Patel and has written for Forbes. 


We know how to write for contractors – our writers have a ton of context on the market, and are constantly sharpening our persuasive + SEO skills.
Making sure it’s organized well, crawlable & technically sound, we stay up to date on algorithm changes and take advantage of new opportunities.
We have relationships with 1000’s of websites, and can get links through guest articles and other methods proven to increase traffic.  
Low priority, easy to overlook, and limited by team experience  
Learn as you go with less data to compare to and difficult to pivot  
Smaller scale due to limited capacity; potentially disconnected from results   
Staying informed about your SEO progress is crucial for making strategic decisions, and we ensure you have access to real-time insights every step of the way. With our comprehensive approach, you’ll always know what targeted content and links are being created to boost your online presence.
We provide live data that tracks your traffic and leads, along with an estimated traffic value comparison to last year, so you can see the tangible impact of our efforts. Our commitment to transparency means you’ll have complete clarity on what has been accomplished and what’s on the horizon, allowing you to stay engaged and confident in your home service SEO strategy.
  * of the targeted content and links being created
  * – traffic & leads + estimated traffic value compared to last year
  * on what’s been completed & what we’re working on next


That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.


##### Should I use an agency or do an internal hire?
The basic habits of home services can bring you a long way, without deep knowledge – but 10+ years doing this has taught me that real expertise takes time.
That’s why with a team of 28 all dedicated to increasing website traffic and conversion, multiplied by an avg. 40 hours a week – 1120 hours a week total learning what works and what doesn’t, rubbing shoulders, sharing knowledge with each other – allows us to go deeper than the average in-house SEO.
For most growth-oriented businesses we believe hiring a SEO Services company is smarter than hiring in-house. You benefit from 1000’s of hours of testing and refining processes.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
Our contracts start out as 12-month contracts, and go month-to-month from there. SEO does take time, but we make sure to talk about clear ROI in 6-9-12 months, and it starts to compound after that. We suggest people don’t work with an SEO company if they don’t plan on thinking long-term about SEO.
We’re probably not the best choice if you aren’t willing to work with us for a year or longer.
Almost everything we do will continue to benefit for a long time. Writing guest articles for other websites that link back to you, the content we write on your site, and in some cases, the P.R. mentions we’ve earned back to your site will continue to benefit you and potentially even increase lightly in effectiveness over the next 6-12 months after you stopped working with us / even if you stopped working with us. That being said NEW EFFORT regularly, is what will ensure that that graph doesn’t level off and even start dropping in the long-term.
And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.

We choose to build custom designed and coded websites because they’re faster, more secure, better branded, and easy for anyone to work on. We want you to own your own marketing, which means that you shouldn’t have to worry about a builder breaking, digging through confusing code, or a super slow site.
**Your website should be the member of your sales team that’s working 24/7.** If it’s turning customers away because it doesn’t accurately showcase your company or set you apart from competitors, that’s a problem. It’s time to invest in a website that is built to grow with you and your digital marketing efforts.
#### **“Will a New Website Make Me Money?” You Might Be Surprised.**
While the home service industry is an in-person and hands-on industry, your customers are making most of their day-to-day decisions online. Does your online presence reflect the quality of the services you offer? If not, it might be time to invest in the tool that helps you generate leads – your website. Give this video a quick watch to learn more about how a new website can help make you money!
Investing thousands of dollars into a custom-built site might seem like an unnecessary luxury, but maybe it’s time to reframe how you think about your website. You get what you pay for. After designing and building hundreds of websites, our proven “Winning Website Formula” is leaving a mark in the home service industry.
  * Don’t waste time explaining your business model to a non contractor-focused agency. Let’s focus on saving you time and getting you the results you want. 
  * We build with SEO in mind from the beginning – your website is a tool to get your more leads and present you as a professional force in the digital world. 
  * Customers make decisions based on professionalism & communication, and your website is often the first thing they see! Dress your website for success just like you do your sales team. 


Many websites make the mistake of not putting the customer experience first. Our websites are readable, interactive, modern, and clearly call people to take the next action on the website. 
If you have a beautiful website, but no one comes – is it effective? Absolutely not – that’s why we build every website with SEO in mind – from the structure to the content and performance. 
You need a website that can grow with your business. All of the sections we’ll design and build are flexible and customizable. And once the foundation is laid, you can easily build an addition!  
Unreliable (may break!), confusing user experience, & poor conversion rate   
Whether you’re a business owner or marketing manager, your time is valuable. We do our best to keep our meetings efficient and productive. Interested in our full process? Check it out .
  * We’ll start with a meeting to get to know your company, your ideal customers, and your design likes and dislikes. Not sure what you’re looking for? We’ll have lots of examples.
  * About a week after our kickoff, we’ll meet to look at a draft of your homepage design. We want to make sure we have the “thumbs up” from you to keep going with the design.
  * We’ll walk through your full website design file, discuss your first impressions, and send you the design file for feedback.
  * One week later, we’ll meet to discuss the edits we’ve made based on your feedback and talk about design sign-off.
  * Sit back and leave your website in our hands. It’ll take us about 45 days to develop your custom site, do QA, & finish content entry.
  * Before launching your new website, you’ll have time to review your website and request content edits. We’ll also have a pre-launch meeting to make sure everything is ready to go for launch
  * Give us the day to roll out the website, take care of redirects, and make sure you’re getting forms & calls. We’ll send some champagne to celebrate the launch with you!


## The Ideal Customer Journey: Make Sure Your Website Has the Right Focus
Many marketing agencies miss the mark when it comes to understanding contractors and their customers—they just don’t ask the right questions or have the industry knowledge. We believe that digging into your customer’s story is key to effective home service websites. Who are your ideal customers? Why do they need you? What do you do to make sure you get that Google 5-Star review at the end of their project? At Hook, we know how critical it is to get to the heart of your business from the start, which is why we’ve designed a simple yet powerful process to uncover what makes your company unique and tell that story on your website.
Customer service is a lost art in many digital marketing companies, unfortunately. We consider this one of the most important aspects of what we do and critical to our long-term success. **Whereas you might might get lost in the shuffle with another Minneapolis web design team** , our company banks on humility and hard work, our 5-star customer feedback, and extreme responsiveness.Customer service is a lost art in many digital marketing companies, unfortunately. We consider this one of the most important aspects of what we do and critical to our long-term success. **Whereas you might might get lost in the shuffle with another Minneapolis web design team** , our company banks on humility and hard work, our 5-star customer feedback, and extreme responsiveness.
Remodeling web design can be done relatively quickly, but the exact timeline will depend on what you want, how long it takes you to communicate with us and the functionality that you require. Get in touch with us as soon as possible and once we have more information we can give you a more accurate estimation of the time that it will take.
Each ‘Content Management System’ is like a type of car – you wouldn’t try to buy a Toyota from a Porsche dealership. WordPress web design requires some specialization as well – and we’ve worked on WordPress websites for 30+ combined years now, learning the ins and outs of it while finding ways to be more efficient than our competitors.
We honestly want you to have a website you can make changes on yourself and get the most effective solution for a reasonable price. The fact that WordPress is considered ideal for SEO / getting more Google traffic doesn’t hurt either.
##### Why hire a web design team with experience in User Testing, A/B Testing & SEO?
User Testing = Testing websites and making changes based on feedback and confusion. A/B Testing = Testing 2 versions of a design and implementing the one that gets the best results. SEO = Making sure a website is easy for Google to crawl, and making changes to get higher in search results. Besides creating extremely good-looking websites, we know how to make them effective – with over 10+ years experience and 100+ websites designed and tested. Send us a message now for a free consultation!
Our home services web design process generally takes around 100 days to get a fully-custom website you love, designed from scratch and developed by hand, from expert WordPress web developers.
1. We kickoff and extract all the awesome things about your company from you (2 hours tops for the kickoff)
2. Then we design (from scratch) and present it to you. We get feedback from you (the main big pieces of feedback first, and then more granularly in a super easy to use platform called Invision that allows you to comment on the design.)
3. Once we incorporate your feedback in a few rounds of revisions – and you love your website design… we develop that website from scratch in WordPress so it’s easy too edit content, on the backside of your website.
4. We do a 3-part ‘quality assurance’ internally, work with you to get content, and then we launch the website, and make sure everything is in tip-top shape with our launch checklist.
5. We can work with you on SEO if you want!
##### Does your web design team work with companies around the U.S?
Yes we love working with companies all over North America!
Around half of our clients are in other parts of the United States than our home town, and we have a few clients that are international. We have done international websites, that allowed for language switching etc, and are set up correctly for search engines that way.
Most of our clients are locally-focused, meaning they are a local-service provider, going after a particular region or set of regions. So we have a TON of experience, ranking companies locally, whether that’s in Minnesota, Illinois, Texas, or wherever else.
Other clients are trying to go after broader regions, like they are a service provider that works with people all around the United States, and we know how to do that too!

## Page: https://hookagency.com/blog/ai-vs-humans-phone-answering

  *   *   * 

But is that effecting booking rate? When should you be using A.I. and when should you be utilizing humans?
Some level of AI phone answering —, especially for home service companies where every missed call is lost revenue.
In this deep dive, we’re exploring how leading companies like are turning AI into a —without sacrificing the trust, empathy, and complexity-handling only humans can offer. 
We’ll unpack the hybrid model that’s working today, where AI still struggles, and how to prep your team for a future that’s already here. Strap in for a pink-collared reality check. 
> 76% of consumers say they expect “immediate” responses from businesses—within 5 minutes or less.
The AI wave is hitting harder and faster than most industries. Why? Because the average , , or electrical company runs lean—and every unanswered phone call equals a job (and revenue) lost.
Michelle Myers, co-founder of , put it bluntly in our recent conversation:
> “AI is slapping the call center industry like a wrecking ball—and I’m here for it.”
  * AI voice agents are no longer clunky and robotic—they sound like humans, use natural pauses, and can understand slang and regional accents.
  * The rise of means your AI isn’t just reading a script—it’s and customizing responses on the fly.
  * Tools like and are giving contractors centralized dashboards to manage AI + human call flow in real-time.


> Missed calls account for 25–35% of potential revenue loss in . Companies answering 90%+ of inbound calls earn 23% more per month than their competitors.
Pink Callers is pioneering a that blends AI’s reliability with human empathy. Here’s the formula they’ve rolled out across hundreds of contractor accounts:
  * **Live humans handle calls M–F from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. (local time).**
  * **AI handles full shifts overnight (10 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and weekends (8 a.m. to 10 p.m.).**
  * AI also acts as during peak hours, answering when humans are tied up.


Michelle calls their AI agent , named after her daughter. Paige isn’t a gimmick—she’s a machine-learning workhorse, constantly analyzing live human calls, adjusting phrasing, and escalating when needed.
> “If you hire the right Sherpa, and you’ve got the right tools, you can climb this AI mountain together,” Michelle said.
The secret sauce isn’t the AI—it’s the . Paige listens and learns. When she messes up? The Pink Callers team flags the issue, sends it to their developers, and retrains the model—
Let’s be real: AI still can’t feel—but it can , , and . That’s why it’s dominating these areas:
  * AI shines when a customer is panicked and just needs a tech ASAP.
  * “I live at 452 West Maple. My water heater is leaking.” AI can intake this, schedule service, and even route to the right tech.
  * Tired of voicemail black holes at night? AI fills that gap without adding staff.
  * New LLMs allow AI to handle up to 15 languages natively and switch mid-call when needed.


> AI can reduce customer service costs by up to 30% while increasing customer satisfaction scores by 10–20%.
This is why Michelle predicts the shift from 90% human to 90% AI in .
> “The companies that walk this path now will be the ones saving money, retaining talent, and scaling faster later.”
Yes, AI is fast. But it’s still not . And it definitely doesn’t have . That’s where your team comes in.
  * When the customer is angry, confused, or dealing with a complex issue, you need a human.
  * Want someone to chat about the weather or remember the client’s dog’s name? That’s not AI—yet.
  * Cross-selling and upselling during service calls still require emotional intelligence and persuasion skills AI doesn’t have (yet).
  * A Midwest HVAC tech and a New York homeowner speak two different languages, even if it’s English. Your local reps still add value.


> “Consumers don’t want just AI—they want the ,” Michelle explained. “Some of our partners let the caller decide: wait 3–5 minutes for a human, or press 1 to talk to an AI right now. That’s working really well.”
One of the biggest fears around AI is job loss. But what if AI didn’t eliminate jobs—it them?
That’s what Pink Callers is betting on. Their goal isn’t to replace CSRs—it’s to **turn them into tech adoption specialists, escalation experts, and CRM power users.**
> “I want to create jobs,” Michelle said. “They’ll just be jobs. We’re over-educating our team so they’re not just employable—they’re in demand.”
That’s not just fluff. Pink Callers invested in for 15+ of their team, making them the . That gives them access to better tools—and positions their team as , not just phone jockeys.
> 88% of business leaders say AI skills will be critical in customer support roles by 2026.
Let’s cut the polite talk: if you’re running Facebook ads, Google LSA, or local , and your calls are going unanswered or sent to voicemail after 5 p.m.? 
> “Marketing without call answering is like spending $1,000 on fishing gear and cutting the line every time you get a bite,” said Tim Brown of Hook Agency.
If you’re serious about growth, here’s what you need to do next:
  * Audit your . How fast are you really answering?
  * Calculate . Every missed call = $200–$2,500 depending on your ticket size.
  * Deploy . You don’t have to go all-in on Day 1.
  * Train your humans to , not fear them.


> “This isn’t about tech vs. people—it’s about making sure the right is in the seat. And sometimes, that person is AI.”
So stop seeing AI as the enemy. It’s your most loyal employee—it never takes a day off, never gets sick, and never misses a detail.
If you’re ready to scale your home service business, reduce missed calls, and build a customer experience that never sleeps? **It’s time to partner with AI—and the right humans to guide it.**

and home service businesses are constantly trying to stand out in a jam-packed market. Whether it’s online ads, truck wraps, yard signs, or radio spots, the goal is the same: boost visibility and get a return on investment (ROI).
One of the more “love it or hate it” tools in the marketing toolbox is the good old-fashioned billboard. Some swear by its power to build brand recognition. Others call it a wallet-burner with not much to show for it. So who’s right?
The cons and common pitfalls you gotta watch out for
Let’s dive in and see if billboards can actually move the needle for your business.
When it comes to marketing for contractors and home service businesses, billboards are all about brand awareness — direct lead generation. And missing that distinction can cost you a lot more than just a few bucks.
> “Billboard advertising is only for name recognition, and it works.”
Think of a billboard like planting a seed in your future customer’s mind. You’re not asking them to pull over and call you — you’re building familiarity, trust, and a little mental real estate for when they need you.
  * She passes your roofing company’s billboard five times a week for months.
  * One day, a hailstorm hits, and her roof takes a beating.
  * She Googles “roofers near me” and sees ten different companies.
  * Even if she doesn’t consciously remember your billboard, she recognizes your name. She feels a little nudge of trust.
  * She clicks on your link or gives you a call — all because you were already living rent-free in her brain.


This is called the — a psychological principle where repeated exposure to a brand, logo, or name makes people to trust it, even if they don’t know why.
Billboards work best when you see them as a long-term investment in your reputation — not a magic switch to flood your calendar.
If you’re expecting the phone to start blowing up the first week your billboard goes up, you’re setting yourself up for a rough ride. The real value sneaks up slow — and then shows up big.
Billboards aren’t some magic bullet for contractors — but when you know their real purpose (and set the right expectations), they can absolutely move the needle.
Here’s why some contractors still bet big on billboard marketing:
On a busy freeway, your ad could catch hundreds of thousands of eyeballs every single week.
That’s a serious amount of brand impressions — happening on autopilot.
It’s standing tall, built into the backdrop of daily life, where people can’t help but notice it.
Over time, that steady exposure carves a spot in your future customers’ minds — no swipe, click, or scroll required.
Billboards work by quietly planting your brand name into people’s minds long before they’re shopping for your service.
By the time they need a roofer, plumber, or tech, your name feels like the safe, easy choice — even if they can’t quite figure out why.
You’re showing up right where your future customers live, work, and drive — putting your name in their everyday routines.
A hyper-local billboard campaign makes you look like you’re — a hometown favorite before they even meet you.
No budget caps. No algorithm updates. No switching it off by accident.Just a steady, reliable beat of brand exposure — 24/7.
Perfect if you want a marketing asset that keeps working while you’re closing deals, leading your team, or taking a Thursday afternoon off to clear your head.
But if your goal is brand recognition, local dominance, and long-game trust-building, they can be a slick piece of the puzzle — especially when paired with high-converting digital lead generation.
But before you start throwing big money at the sky, it’s worth slowing down and sizing up the real challenges.
Here’s what contractors and home service pros should watch for:
Depending on your city, a single billboard could run you anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000+ per month — and premium spots can even faster.
Even in smaller towns, locking one down for $4,000 over six months can add up — especially if the phone doesn’t start ringing right away.
If you’re running a lean marketing budget, you need to think hard about whether those dollars could work harder somewhere else.
Billboards live in the “trust me, bro” category when it comes to tracking.
Sure, you can slap a custom phone number or landing page on them — and you should — but even then, it’s hard to know exactly how much action they’re driving.
> If you’re the kind of operator who likes seeing the cold, hard numbers pile up fast — billboards might leave you pacing around wondering what you’re getting.
If you’re hungry for quick wins and fast lead flow, billboards probably aren’t your best first move.
With digital, you can tweak your targeting, adjust your message, and double down on what’s working — 
Billboards? Once it’s up, it’s up. Set in stone until the contract’s done
Billboards can absolutely boost brand presence if you play the long game.
But if you’re laser-focused on and , it might be smarter to build your foundation with direct-response marketing first — and save the billboard for when you’re ready to flex a little.
Billboards can help build brand familiarity — but real-world contractor feedback shows they often struggle to deliver fast, measurable returns.
Here’s a deeper look at the lessons contractors have learned:
While the dream is massive brand exposure turning into steady leads, the reality often falls short.
A contractor reported spending significant money — $920/month in one case, $4,000 for six months in another — and only closing a single job from the effort.
When you factor in production costs, design fees, and the commitment of long-term leases, it’s easy to find yourself upside down if leads don’t materialize quickly.
> Billboards create awareness, but they don’t typically create an immediate pipeline.
> If you’re expecting a flood of inbound calls, you’re setting yourself up for a frustrating ride. It’s a play, not a quick win.
That’s why many contractors recommend billboards only your foundational marketing is dialed in and you’re operating from a position of strength — not when you’re still chasing fast cash flow.
Contractors often describe the feeling of pride that comes with seeing their brand towering over a busy highway.
It’s a legitimizing moment. You feel like you’ve made it.
And to be clear — that pride for morale, for your team, and for your own confidence.
But when you strip out the emotions and look purely at business impact, the numbers tell a different story.
One contractor who invested heavily in a billboard campaign said:
> _“It was cool seeing them daily, but a waste of money from my experience.”_
The billboard made him feel good — but it didn’t make the phone ring often enough to justify the investment.
> Feelings are great. But feelings without financial return are a luxury most growing contractors can’t afford. Billboards might feed your soul, but they probably won’t feed your bottom line — at least not right away.


But even with these wins, converting attention into actual paying customers proved difficult.
Most billboards weren’t tied to a direct offer, a compelling call-to-action, or any clear next step for the customer. There was no “bridge” between seeing the name on the highway and booking a service call.
Even the ones that tried using custom phone numbers or dedicated landing pages admitted it was tough to track or connect the dots.
> Exposure alone is never enough.Without a clear reason for people to take action — and an easy way to do it — the value of that exposure evaporates quickly.
If you’re not pairing brand plays like billboards with a smart lead capture and nurture strategy, you’re leaving most of the value sitting on the side of the road.
Billboards can absolutely help contractors build long-term brand presence and lay the groundwork for future trust.
But if you’re early in your growth curve — or if your pipeline isn’t rock-solid yet — they’re probably not the move you want to bet big on right now.
Most contractors found — , Google Ads, Local Service Ads — delivered better lead flow, faster feedback loops, and a clearer path to ROI.
When you’ve got reliable lead flow and strong cash reserves, consider layering in billboards to amplify your brand and dominate your local market long-term.
If you need immediate results and real, trackable ROI, there are smarter ways to spend your marketing dollars than throwing them at the sky.
Especially if you’re trying to grow a or contracting business, is where the real magic happens.
is hands-down one of the strongest long-term moves you can make.
When you rank higher in Google, you’re showing up for what you do — not hoping they remember your name from a billboard three months later.


SEO’s not an overnight fix. It takes a few months to really catch fire.
But once it’s rolling? It’s like lead flow on autopilot — without the big monthly ad bill.
You can target specific keywords like “emergency AC repair near me” or “best company [Your City]” — and show up at the very top of Google instantly.
  * Snap up immediate visibility when people are ready to hire
  * Target the jobs and cities that make you the most money


PPC brings quick leads. SEO locks in long-term growth. Best of both worlds.
Social ads are another option if you want to mix branding and direct leads.
You can laser-target homeowners based on where they live, their age, whether they own a home, and even life events like moving or .
  * Run local awareness campaigns that keep you top of mind
  * Retarget people who already visited your website and bring them back to convert


With Facebook ads, you’re building brand recognition driving direct leads — not just crossing your fingers and hoping people notice you.
But if you’re hungry for fast, measurable growth? SEO, PPC, and Facebook Ads are great things to start out with.
  * You can scale what’s working and cut what’s not — no guesswork.


But if you’re focused on fast, trackable growth? 
They’re expensive, hard to measure, and — for a lot of contractors — they deliver way more emotional satisfaction than actual ROI.
If you’re just getting started, or you need leads , smart money says double down on , , and .
Billboards make way more sense — when your pipeline’s strong and you’re looking to flex your brand in a bigger way across your community.

  *   *   * 

Choosing the right CRM isn’t just about features — it’s about fit, function, and finances. today rely heavily on digital tools to streamline everything from project management to customer communication. But as the number of CRM options grows, so do the frustrations around hidden costs, underwhelming support, and tools that overpromise and underdeliver.
> _“Never used AccuLynx because everyone says it’s expensive for no reason.”_ – Jason McGahey
  * — especially when core features cost extra
  * in Facebook groups, forums, and DMs anyways
  * for companies scaling at different stages


The goal of this article is to break down the current state of AccuLynx pricing in 2025, highlight what real roofers are saying about it, and offer a few insights into what might be a better fit based on your company’s size, budget, and tech needs. Read on!
AccuLynx is a -specific CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform built to help manage every phase of a roofing project — from lead intake to final invoice. It’s designed to be an all-in-one software solution, aiming to eliminate the need for multiple disconnected tools.  
Lets users build custom estimates with templates and real-time pricing  
AccuLynx has long been considered one of the most established CRMs in the roofing space. It’s particularly common among:
  * managing dozens of jobs at a time
  * Contractors looking for a CRM with 


However, as you’ll see in the next sections, being a veteran in the space doesn’t always guarantee loyalty — especially when competitors are innovating faster and offering more flexible pricing.
AccuLynx doesn’t publish its pricing online, which means roofing contractors must go through a sales call to get a quote. While some appreciate the flexibility this offers based on company size and needs, others feel the lack of transparency makes it harder to compare options or budget effectively.
Based on community feedback, here’s what many contractors say they’re seeing:
  * apply for features like SmartDocs, texting, customer portals, and integrations
  * over the years have left some longtime users frustrated


As competitors continue offering bundled, flat-rate CRMs, roofers say AccuLynx’s pricing model is starting to feel outdated:
  * Features that are standard elsewhere often come at an 
  * are seeing shifts in pricing terms and feature access
  * There’s growing pressure to justify premium pricing with premium performance


In short, AccuLynx’s pricing isn’t one-size-fits-all — and in today’s CRM market, that cuts both ways.
While AccuLynx offers a robust feature set, many users have voiced concerns about how those features are priced — particularly when it comes to tools that feel essential to daily operations.
Several contractors have called out a pattern: instead of bundling core functionality into their base subscription, AccuLynx often charges separately for things like:


This approach has created a growing perception that the platform prioritizes monetization over user experience.
It’s not just about the money — it’s about the expectations. Many contractors feel that the tools AccuLynx charges extra for are now standard in modern CRMs, and should be included without additional fees.
That said, not every roofer sees it as a dealbreaker. For businesses that use the platform to its full potential, the added costs may be worth it — but it’s clear that the value proposition is under more scrutiny than ever.
Contractors across the country have been vocal about their experience with AccuLynx — especially when it comes to value for the money. In 2025, the general sentiment seems to be shifting: while some teams still rely heavily on the platform, many others are reconsidering based on price and evolving feature expectations.
Across community threads and online groups, several key themes stand out:
  * Many feel the , especially when competitors offer similar tools at lower rates
  * Others say , while once-included features are now extra
  * Some long-time users have left the platform, citing 


That said, not every roofer is frustrated. Some contractors still feel the platform pays off when used to its full potential.
The bottom line? AccuLynx still has a place in the market — but contractors are more informed and comparison-shopping than ever before.
As more contractors reevaluate the cost and flexibility of their CRM, a wave of roofers are moving away from AccuLynx in favor of platforms that feel more affordable, intuitive, or better aligned with how modern teams work.
Here are the platforms that keep coming up in roofer conversations — and why they’re gaining traction:
The most frequently mentioned alternative by far. Roofers praise it for combining sales, automation, and communication tools in one straightforward system — without stacking fees.
Still a favorite for smaller to mid-sized contractors looking for customization and affordability. Some users feel it’s less polished than AccuLynx but more flexible.


A strong choice for contractors focused on sales presentations, financing, and field operations. Some users have returned to Leap after leaving AccuLynx due to cost concerns.
Known for its simplicity and affordability. It may not be as feature-rich as AccuLynx, but it covers the basics well — and at a fraction of the cost.
  * – praised for being “better and cheaper” by recent adopters
  * or – attractive to tech-forward contractors looking to build custom workflows or tap into AI capabilities


If there’s a clear takeaway here, it’s that roofers are prioritizing — and they’re not afraid to jump ship when a platform doesn’t keep up.
For some roofing companies, AccuLynx still delivers — especially if you’ve already built your operations around it and are using it to its full potential. It’s a well-established platform with solid features, deep industry roots, and integrations that work well for high-volume teams.
But for many contractors in 2025, the conversation isn’t just about features — it’s about , , and .
  * You manage a and need detailed job tracking
  * You don’t mind paying extra for add-ons if the platform is delivering ROI


**And here’s when it might be time to look elsewhere:**
  * You’re a trying to keep software costs manageable
  * You’re ready to switch to a tool with 


AccuLynx isn’t a bad platform — it’s just facing more competition than ever before. And in a market where contractors expect more for less, every dollar counts.
Choosing a CRM is a big decision — and one that can have a major impact on how efficiently your roofing business runs. AccuLynx has been a trusted name in the industry for years, but in 2025, many contractors are asking harder questions about what they’re paying for and what they’re getting in return.
**Are you comfortable with the long-term cost — including add-ons?**
**Is it easy to switch or scale if your business grows or pivots?**
And maybe most importantly: 
If you’re on the fence, take time to demo multiple platforms, talk to real users, and consider starting with a smaller system that can grow with you.
At the end of the day, the best CRM is the one that helps you , , and — without feeling like you’re being charged for every click.

  * Most electrician websites don’t prioritize TRUST because we don’t realize people need to be SOLD on our website.

Here’s our take on website design for /electrical services with . Our site utilizes clean and modern layouts to drive more leads.
  * We utilize a variety of fun and engaging illustrations that keep viewers engaged longer while reading content. Electric city has a fresh and vibrant color scheme, which made it fun for us to develop CTAs, illustrations and icons for a cohesive viewing experience.


The soft green and grey color palette takes the stress off and puts the user at ease. 
  * Great use of empty space, it allows the user room to breathe. 
  * Love the split spread at the bottom with the booking and contact options. 


  * The transitions are smooth, but some of them feel a little clunky or unnecessary. Less is more.

  * Red is a really dominant color, and this site does a good job of not overdoing it. The hero and navigation allows for visual consistency across all pages, but also allows for customization through the imagery. 


uses moody photography and color choices to highlight a niche area of lighting services.
  * The stylized icons really pop. It fits well with the darker tones of the brand. 
  * Wicks does a nice job of highlighting their unique projects. Their images really stand out against their color palette, and shed light on their services. 


  * While it makes sense to have a darker color scheme for a lighting and electrical company, it can feel a little drowning with all the black. Maybe add in a few grey tones to make the site more welcoming in to introduce a clearer hierarchy with design elements. 


The electrical contractors at are lucky to have this stellar site. It’s clean, refined and concise.
  * The landing page video does a nice job of showing products and finished work, but also the process to get there. The site reiterates the trusting and quality services that Lemberg provides through a simple layout. 


  * Honestly, this is a really clean site. The only thing that seems out of place is the long orange bar on the side. Maybe a little distracting?

  *   *   * 

Your company’s website is an essential part of your marketing strategy.
  * They talk about the 
  * They don’t provide enough clarity about 


A roofing website design is more than a digital business card for your roofing services; it’s a list of your services, a point of contact for your company, and an important sales pitch. Some of the best roofing websites have a few elements in common that entice their audiences to sign up for the companies’ services.
**We love being involved in the roofing industry. People even volunteered for us to roast their roofing website designs! Watch our clients sharing their experience here:**
**– beyond having a great design, you also[turn your roofing website into a traffic magnet with Roofing SEO,](https://hookagency.com/roofing-marketing/seo/) and potentially even .**
  1. A major red flag on a roofing website is when the content is focused more on the company itself rather than the customer. This includes excessive bragging about the company’s achievements, history, or staff, rather than providing useful and relatable content that helps potential customers understand why they should choose this particular roofing company for their needs. The website should empathize with the customer’s pain points and provide clear, helpful solutions.
  2. If a roofing website doesn’t provide clear reasons for a homeowner to trust the company, it can be a red flag. Trust factors can include positive customer testimonials, industry certifications, memberships in professional organizations, and transparency about their team and operations. Lack of such information may cause potential customers to question the company’s credibility and expertise.
  3. A poorly designed, slow, or difficult to navigate roofing site can be a significant red flag. A good roofing website should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also have a user-friendly design that allows visitors to easily find the information they’re looking for. Slow loading times, broken links, or a confusing layout can frustrate visitors and potentially turn them away. Similarly, if a website is not mobile-responsive, it can lead to a poor user experience for a significant portion of the audience who access the web through their mobile devices.
  4. : Your potential customers will likely search for services in their local area. For example, if you’re a roofing company in Denver, you want to rank high for searches like “roofing services in Denver” or “Denver roof repair”. If a roofing website lacks pages dedicated to specific locations they serve, it’s a big red flag. These location-specific pages not only help in local SEO but also provide the necessary information to the local audience about your presence in their area. Furthermore, if there’s a noticeable absence of keyword-optimized content, it’s a sign that the website might not perform well in search engine rankings, making it harder for potential customers to discover the business online. This could result in lost business opportunities.


Your website shouldn’t be the same as your competitors, but there are a few things you can do to turn it into a website that converts visitors to customers. If you visit other roofing company websites, you may notice that the most attractive and engaging ones are those with helpful content and intuitive, eye-catching web designs.
A roofing company’s CONTENT (meaning the written words on the page) and their blog is almost as important as any other piece of the site. Your blog is what can help your site rank in a Google search by targeting keywords that your desired audience might be searching for. Rather than using a roofing blog to talk only about the company itself, roofing companies with winning websites use their blogs for long-form, informative content that helps those interested in roof repair, maintenance, and more.
Also, your website should have other blocks of content that help an audience know what your company does, who’s involved, and how they can contact you. Standout roofing websites typically have pages that list their services, give some company history, provide quotes, display testimonials, and point visitors in the direction of how to contact someone, creating the perfect funnel for leads to sales.

Your roofing web design is an especially important piece of your overall website strategy. Roofing companies with converting websites have exceptional website designs that make their sites easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. 
  * **, as many as 38% of people will leave a site that they feel is poorly designed.**
  * **Another 66% want to view a website or content with a beautiful design and layout rather than those that look dull or too simple.**


But, it’s not only your aesthetic design that matters. If your website is too image-heavy or takes too long to load due to images, plugins, or slow servers, your audience may also turn away and find a different site. 
> It’s equally as important to ensure that your visitors’ overall user experience is one that you’d also enjoy when visiting a website. Most elements of your site should be easy to find from the moment a visitor comes to your site by using a top navigational menu or displaying relevant information on your main page. 
The below examples are some of the best websites for roofing companies based on the common elements that top roofing company websites have in common. When you’re ready to design your website, you can get some inspiration from these examples, which provide users with excellent content and stand-out, yet easy-to-navigate, design.

Many roofing companies make the mistake of going super masculine (and sometimes downright intimidating)
  * Maybe you don’t have to go all the way pink – but do think about who your ideal customer is!
  * Maybe it’s a 48 year old married, working mother of children.
  * How can you soften the design, and curve the edges of things, make it feel feminine to attract those people that might be making the initial contact to your roofing company.


Open Box Roofing’s website is an example of a client who took the feminine all the way – we love this design and think it’s a great example of going all in on their ideal customer.
Northface not only gets 1000’s of leads from it’s website a year, it also feels very consistent with their trucks, yard signs and other marketing. The BEST roofing websites focus on the customer not just the company and this site 100% accomplishes that with headlines like ‘Creating a Home Your Family Deserves’, and pictures of a happy young couple in front of their home.

The best roofing websites know how to get TRUST quickly.
It’s not about the most immaculate color scheme, or even having brilliant images, with smiling happy customers (although that’s ideal) – it’s about helping your prospective customer believe you can help them.
  * Reviews with an image of the reviewer, the logo of the place it was left, and a 5-star icon.
  * Pictures of your real team, show your office, show real customers.
  * The ability to get a free estimate, roof repair, and see how that company has earned respect not from the roofing industry – but from homeowners, and the broader community and internet. 


The problem with themes – or roofing website templates is not that you end up looking like other competitors, although that can happen:
  * Make sure you upload ‘sample content’ – if you purchase a roofing website theme (usually included if you buy a theme.)
  * Many times – it’s ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to make the theme look as good as the demo.
  * The real hard part of making an effective roofing website is the content entry, and the details when you are fitting the development to the actual content. This is something we handle as part of our process, but it involves coding and design chops, so make sure you have a resource (or can handle that yourself) if you buy a roofing website theme or template.


We help our clients identify what type of content is needed, and guide them in that content creation…
But oddly enough – **we don’t suggest that we create the initial ‘about’ content** when making their website design.
Because we believe the main pages on the website – should ideally come from the internal team at your company, so they feel 
Ideally you wouldn’t outsource this content – unless you’re willing to spend much more time, working with that team you’re outsourcing to fully understands your history, the context of your market, and your business model in insane detail.
Otherwise – we strongly suggest that roofing companies write the main pages of your website content yourself.
That being said – we DO help people write blog articles etc, and you can work with a roofing company on things like that. (And we can do this about content / roofing company homepage content if needed.)
  1. Start with a big picture of a smiling person in front of a fresh roof.
  2. Before you scroll twice – have a section with testimonials and reviews, and the pictures of the reviewers.
  3. Use a ‘get a free estimate’ form at the top of each selling page.
  4. Have a horizontal list of certifications, BBB, or awards that looks clean or is in greyscale.
  5. Write your headlines towards the ideal customer (not about your company.)
  6. Put a button with ‘Get a free estimate’ up at the top right of the website on all pages in the menu.
  7. Add a phone number, top right next to or above the get a free estimate button.
  8. Ensure every selling pages has 500 words or more, and text is broken up with images.
  9. Try to keep your forms too 6 or less fields so customers don’t get scared off.
  10. Use bullet points at the top of selling pages, with 10 or less words each, so people scanning can get your ‘key value propositions.’
  11. Ask real happy customers what they like about your company – and use their language in your headlines.
  12. Use ‘show-hide’ FAQ’s to increase the word count and address common questions customers ask in the sales process without overwhelming the page with a ‘wall of text’ that decreases interaction.
  13. The best roofing companies dominating with digital marketing not only offer free estimates, but they also advertise for roof repair on their roofing site, because many of the people that are looking for repairs also can turn into full roof replacments.


  * We help drive traffic to those websites with content + SEO.
  * We care about roofing contractors, and love working with them!

Make these changes now, and start transforming your website into a lead generation machine.
Ensure that your contact information, including your phone number, address, and email, is easy to find on every page of your website. This encourages prospective customers to reach out to you directly and enhances credibility.
Assess the placement and visibility of your CTAs. Make them bold, concise, and persuasive. Remember, the purpose of a CTA is to lead potential customers towards conversion.
Show off your expertise and quality of work. Include customer testimonials and display your industry certifications prominently on your site. This boosts customer confidence and credibility.
Make sure your website has location-specific pages catering to the different areas you serve. Also, ensure your content is SEO-optimized with relevant keywords. This helps improve your search engine rankings, making your business more visible to potential customers online.

By taking these five steps, you can substantially increase the lead-generating potential of your website. So, don’t wait – make these changes today, and start seeing an influx of quality leads for your roofing business.
The best roofing website ideas I have for 2024 and beyond are 1. Put a video on every service page. This will increase the amount of time people spend on average on your site, increasing search rankings. 2. Put the get a quote form right away on every page – often people just want to take the next step and don’t need to read that much. 3. Surround that form with all kinds of ‘trust factors’ and ‘social proof’ like testimonials, and organizations you’re a part of to decrease friction in the prospect’s mind. We believe you should always offer free estimates! 
Because of the pain of not hiring a professional company will be greater than doing it. Even though hiring a professional may cost significantly more than hiring your cousin’s uncle’s nephew’s brother’s friend – it cost less than doing it again in a year and missing out on 90% of the sales while they go to your competitor who actually invested in digital marketing. Do yourself a favor, and invest in a professional company that specializes in roofing websites – whether or not it’s Hook Agency.
The days of word of mouth for local businesses have all but dried up. More and more, like roofers need to rely on the internet to spread the word about their business and give their customers absolute ease in requesting the service. There are many reasons to build a roofing website; these include getting your name out there, increasing your customers’ confidence in your business, and giving your customers a hassle-free experience in hiring your company.The reason roofing websites are so successful at getting your name out there is through a practice called local SEO (search engine optimization). At Hook Agency, it’s our job to know how to get roofing websites ranked as the first result on local Google searches. We won’t go into it too deeply here, but by investing in gaining organic search traffic (as against paid advertising), you’re not only saving money in the long run but gaining higher-quality leads.
People find local roofers through several avenues. The old days of word of mouth have been supplanted by word of text. In addition to search engine searches (primarily Google), people may engage with paid advertising on any of their favorite sites. Review sites like Yelp also play a big part in determining what business people will engage with. 
There are many ways to make a roofing website design. To do it the cheapest way, you could learn HTML and CSS (coding languages required to design a website) and design it yourself. Then again, time is money, and you’d probably prefer to get to what you know best. That leaves you a few options. You could use one of the many website design services like Squarespace, GoDaddy, or WordPress. The benefit of having sites like these host your URL is that their platforms offer code-free experiences. You’re still designing the site yourself, but you don’t have to learn a whole coding language to get your site up and running. Finally, you could hire an experienced roofing website design professional who knows both the web and the roofing business. At Hook Agency, we offer roofing website design services. In addition to making your website look great, we design your site with the customer and, significantly, the search engine in mind. By designing your website from the ground up with local SEO in mind, we can guarantee better search engine results than a roofing website design without a mind for SEO. Plus, if you’re using a service like Squarespace, you’re going to have to pay a monthly premium that will never go down. At Hook Agency, we set you up with the tools you need and send you off, saving you money in the long run.
The best way to get your roofing website seen is to engage in local SEO. Beyond that, paid targeted ads work well. On Google especially, at times more people click on than on sites like Amazon and YouTube. Generating leads is the first step in getting to do what you do best: roofing. Hook Agency will cover everything for you. We’ll create a quality roofing website design and manage your paid ads, ensuring maximum leads for your area.
When making a roofing estimate for your clients, you should keep in mind that most people hiring a professional roofer are not especially familiar with the kinds of labor required and the materials necessary to fix their roofs. Some may have no idea how much roofing should cost, causing them to raise their eyebrows when you show them your estimate. It’s good practice to go over your estimate line by line with your clients, making sure they understand what they’re paying for and why it would need to cost that much. By going over your estimate line by line with your customer, you can explain why your proposal might be higher but more accurate. You could speak to how many layers of the old roof need to be torn off; some will underestimate this figure to win the proposal, then add the cost only after the work is complete.Simply put, include everything that is going to cost on the estimate, whether a drip edge needs to be installed or if there’s rotten decking that needs replacing. Whatever it is, honesty is the best policy, so long as you follow it up with a line-by-line review of the estimate with the client.

  5. : Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly on smartphones and tablets. With the majority of local searches being performed on mobile devices, having a responsive website is crucial for ranking higher in local search results.

Organic efforts and paid advertising campaigns are two distinct strategies for boosting the visibility of your home service business in Google’s local pack.

On the other hand, paid search involves running targeted ads that appear at the top of SERPs.
With organic SEO, you focus on creating high-quality content, optimizing your website structure, and obtaining backlinks from reputable sources. This approach takes time and effort but can yield long-lasting results. 
In contrast, paid search allows you to quickly reach a wider audience by bidding on keywords relevant to your business. However, it requires a financial investment that may not be sustainable for all businesses.
While paid advertising can provide immediate visibility, there are several benefits to prioritizing for your home service business:

  2. : While paid ads require continuous investment, organic traffic is essentially free once you’ve optimized your website effectively. This makes organic growth a cost-effective strategy in the long run.
  3. Credibility and Trust: Users often perceive websites that rank organically as more trustworthy compared to those appearing as ads. Building credibility through organic rankings can enhance brand reputation and increase customer trust.
  4. Long-Term Competitive Advantage: Organic rankings tend to be more stable than paid positions since they are not influenced by bidding wars or budget limitations. By consistently improving your organic presence, you gain a competitive edge over businesses relying solely on paid advertising.


While organic growth should be a primary focus, incorporating targeted paid ads can complement your overall . Here are some tactics to consider:
  1. : Identify high-intent keywords that align with your home service business and integrate them into your website’s content. This helps improve organic rankings while also guiding your paid ad campaigns.
  2. : Use features in paid advertising platforms to ensure your ads are shown to users in specific locations where you offer services. This allows you to target potential customers within your service area effectively.
  3. : Implement remarketing campaigns to re-engage users who have previously visited your website but did not convert. Combining organic efforts with remarketing ads can increase brand recall and conversion rates.
  4. : Take advantage of ad extensions such as location and call extensions to provide additional information about your business within the search results.


Incorporating the name of your city or region into your website content, meta tags, and headings helps search engines understand where you operate. This increases the likelihood of your business appearing in relevant local searches.
In addition to location-based keywords, optimizing for long-tail queries can also be beneficial. These are more specific search terms that potential customers might use when looking for a particular home service. For example, instead of just targeting “plumber,” you could optimize for “emergency plumber in [city]” or “water heater installation services.” By including these long-tail queries in your website content, you increase the chances of ranking higher in search results.
Google Search Console is a valuable tool for monitoring the performance of your website in search engines. By integrating your website with Google Search Console, you gain insights into how your site is indexed and ranked by Google’s algorithms. This allows you to identify any issues affecting your visibility in search results and make necessary optimizations.
With , you can track important metrics like organic traffic, click-through rates, and keyword rankings. By analyzing this data, you can identify which pages are performing well and which need improvement. This information helps you understand how to optimize your website content and structure to better align with what users are searching for.
To optimize your ad campaigns and increase visibility in the Local Pack, consider implementing these tips:
  1. : Conduct thorough keyword research to identify relevant keywords that potential customers might use when searching for home services. Incorporate these keywords strategically into your ad copy and landing page content.
  2. : Take advantage of ad extensions offered by Google Ads to provide additional information about your business, such as location, phone number, and reviews. This helps users make informed decisions and increases the chances of them clicking on your ad.
  3. : Use geotargeting to ensure your ads are shown to users in specific locations where you provide services. This helps you reach a more relevant audience and improves the likelihood of generating qualified leads.
  4. : Analyze data from Google Ads to identify peak times when users are most likely to search for home services. Schedule your ads to appear during these high-demand periods to maximize visibility and increase the chances of conversions.

If you’re a contractor that isn’t already on Google Local Service ads, you’re missing out.
Lucky for you though, we wrote this post to get you caught up on all the great opportunities that you’re currently missing out on.
The great thing about Google Local Services ads is that they help you to get connected with the people that are out there searching for businesses and services like you. When a customer searches for a business like you in your service area, you will show up and be easier for them to find. And a great thing about this too is that you don’t need to pay unless a customer calls you directly through that ad. This gets your business in front of their eyes so they can find you when they need you.
1. The first reason you should sign up for Google Local Service ads is that they show up on the top of the Google search results page. More specifically, they will appear on Google search as well as on the local services site for local customers looking for services you offer.
2. They’re super credible and have a nice green trust factor that says “I’m Google guaranteed.” You will be screened and can become a Google Guaranteed provider that will give you a badge for your business. This will give your business more credibility and give customers the confidence they need to choose your business and services.
3. Another great thing about these is that they’re super easy for you to set up. You don’t need to be a tech wizard with a lot of Google experience to be able to do this.
1. Be prepared to pick the right email address that you want to set it up with, we recommend using the same email that you are using for your Google My Business and Google Analytics pages
2. One thing you need to do is be ready for some paperwork. Your technicians will need to pass a free (for now) background check that is done through Google’s provider. You will also be required to meet the licensing and insurance requirements that they have. However, this does not apply to all industries in order to participate in local service ads.
Another requirement they ask you to do is notifying the company that performed the background check about any new employees or legal issues that may impact your eligibility. You will also be required to recertify for local services every now and then as well.
3. Be prepared to wait. It takes a bit to set up but, all in all, is super easy, prominent, and is also a great way for to get leads. It is a great online marketing tactic that you can own yourself and make it happen.
If you want to get the most out of these, it is important that you do a few things right.
It is crucial that you fill out your application correctly as Google will use the information that you provide in the actual ad you put out and as of now, there is no way for you to edit that on your own. So make sure that you have all your information entered correctly or you will not be able to get the benefits of this great tool.
You are able to manage the ads through both the website and the Google app. Once you are on there, you can turn your ads on and off, adjust your target settings, respond to leads that come in, as well as request reviews from customers whose contact information you have.
When it comes to the support from Google, they’re having many changes to the platform that are being made, so be aware of that when you are getting things set up and going.
One of the best things about these ads is that you will only need to pay for the leads that are relative to the services that you offer and the business you receive. The costs may also vary with the type of lead, location, and the job type that is needed. The times where you are going to pay is if you get a message or phone call that comes through the platform.
Another perk you will have is that you won’t have to waste as much time with all those pesky spam calls. If you get a lead that isn’t legit, you have the ability to take it up with Google and possibly even get your money back (never hurts to try!). Another great thing about this payment structure is that you won’t go over your monthly budget, and if you do end up getting leads that go over your budget, they are credited back to you.
Your cost is not going to be difficult to manage. One of the ways you can do this is by making a weekly budget that is based on how many leads you are looking to receive, and track you progress through the app in the payment and charge history section of the app.
As you can see above, there are many great benefits to using Local Google Service ads for your business.
They are easy to use, and while they may take a bit to set up, it is still a fairly easy process and one that is definitely worth doing.
Thank you for reading this! Now go out there and execute!

Formerly known as Levergy, this agency is now part of the Kickcharge creative powerhouse. That means world-class branding paired with performance marketing. Their PPC division knows how to match sharp design with high-converting ads.


If you’re rebranding and ramping up lead generation at the same time, Kickcharge’s newly expanded services are a strong fit. Expect creative flair paired with data-driven campaigns.
Rival Digital made its name in , but they’ve earned trust with garage door companies through niche-specific content and paid advertising. Their team is small, responsive, and strategic—helping businesses get more from every dollar.

  *   *   * 

Ask a group of what brand makes the best equipment, and you won’t get a unanimous answer — and that’s kind of the point. .
The “best” brand isn’t just about who has the flashiest marketing or the biggest name. It comes down to what works for business, installs, and customers.


We rounded up real feedback from working pros across the country to find out which brands they stand behind — and why. Their answers offer a practical look at what actually makes equipment worth installing again and again.
Before diving into specific brands, a few HVAC pros made one thing clear: the equipment itself is only part of the equation.
You can have the highest-rated system on the market, but if it’s poorly installed or unsupported after the sale, the homeowner won’t care what name is on the label. And neither will the bad reviews.
For many contractors, success isn’t about selling a specific brand — it’s about selling company, their craftsmanship, and their service.
This mindset shifts the focus from “what unit should I sell?” to “how can I make this install bulletproof?” Because at the end of the day, the system is only as good as the team putting it in and standing behind it.
A great install from a trusted contractor can make even a mid-tier brand perform like a premium product. And a bad install? It’ll make any system a headache.
While every contractor has their favorites, a few brands rose to the top in our comment roundup — not just for name recognition, but for real-world dependability, support, and profitability.
is one of the most established names in HVAC, known for its innovation and high-performance systems across residential and commercial markets. Founded in 1895, Lennox International operates multiple manufacturing and R&D facilities across North America — including its flagship center in Carrollton, Texas.
  * Furnaces, heat pumps, air conditioners, air handlers, packaged units, and mini-splits


Lennox was one of the most frequently mentioned brands in our comment thread — trusted for its long-standing quality, solid consumer recognition, and deep dealer support network.
As one of the largest HVAC manufacturers globally, has a significant footprint in the U.S. residential and light commercial market. After acquiring Goodman in 2012, Daikin expanded its reach and built the largest HVAC manufacturing facility in the U.S. — the Daikin Texas Technology Park near Houston.
  * A full range of air conditioners, heat pumps, furnaces, and ductless systems


Contractors consistently cited support, rebates, and private label options as major advantages. Whether you’re looking to build your brand or streamline your operations, this family of brands delivers flexibility and value.
, the parent company of both and , has a reputation for engineering-driven HVAC systems that perform well in both residential and commercial environments. Trane was founded in 1913 and is known for energy-efficient systems and long product life cycles.


These brands are trusted for reliability, but they’re also backed by strong dealer incentives, long warranties, and broad consumer awareness — making them a smart choice for companies that want both performance and sales confidence.
Beyond the major players, many HVAC contractors turn to brands that excel in specific categories — whether it’s ductless systems, value-driven heat pumps, or strong local distributor relationships. These brands may not dominate every national top-five list, but they earn loyal followings for good reason.
Both and are recognized leaders in ductless mini-split and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) technology. Their systems are widely used in residential retrofits, light commercial applications, and anywhere zoned comfort is a priority.


Contractors love the performance — but they especially appreciate the strong technical support and training programs offered by local distributors.
For contractors looking to offer high-efficiency systems without high-end price tags, and came up as trusted go-tos.
  * Bosch is known for inverter-driven heat pumps that offer quiet, consistent performance


Both brands are ideal for homeowners looking for efficient systems without going full premium
Several additional brands were highlighted by name, often because of their warranty programs, price points, or distributor relationships:
  * – A sub-brand of Allied Air (Lennox) with solid dealer support
  * – Private label lines some contractors swear by


These niche brands may not have the name recognition of Lennox or Trane, but they often fill important gaps — whether that’s serving a specific market segment or offering competitive margins to the contractor.
While some contractors stick with name brands for the recognition and built-in trust, others take a different route: private labeling.
Private-labeled HVAC systems — often sourced from major manufacturers like , , or — allow contractors to put their own company’s name on the equipment. And for many, that strategy offers serious upside.
  * – Cut out the premium price tag and control your pricing strategy
  * – Position your system as exclusive or tailored to your service
  * – Tap into perks often offered by suppliers to promote your own line


For contractors focused on growing their own brand and boosting profitability, private-labeled systems offer more control — and often, fewer headaches when it comes to pricing battles or brand comparison shopping by homeowners.
That said, private label success depends heavily on and . It’s not just about slapping your logo on the box — it’s about standing behind the equipment long after install day.
While brand features, SEER ratings, and warranties matter — many contractors say the real difference-maker isn’t the name on the unit. It’s the relationship behind the product.
Over and over, pros emphasized that their loyalty often comes down to — not just during the sale, but when things go wrong.
  * – Fast access to replacement components to keep jobs on track
  * – Hands-on classes, install guidance, and tech support
  * – Help with marketing, signage, and team incentives
  * – Responsive reps who pick up the phone when it matters


Even the most trusted brands can become a headache if your distributor goes dark when you need help. On the flip side, a great supplier can make a mid-tier brand feel like a premium experience — both for your techs and your customers.
For many contractors, the decision isn’t just they install, but they’re buying it from.
There’s no universal “best” HVAC brand — only the one that fits company’s goals, installs, and growth strategy. Whether you’re a high-volume service provider or a boutique installer focused on premium systems, the right fit comes down to more than just product specs.
Here are some smart ways to narrow down your options:
  * Are your customers cost-conscious or willing to invest in high-efficiency upgrades?
  * Do you need equipment with strong cold-weather performance or ductless options?


Understanding what your typical job looks like will help guide the level of product performance and flexibility you need.
  * How fast can you get parts or equipment if something goes wrong mid-job?


Even a great brand can become a burden if the supplier experience is inconsistent.
  * Look for brands that offer rebates, spiffs, or co-marketing support
  * Evaluate the warranty process — is it simple, or a paperwork nightmare?
  * Private label options may also increase your profit margin and brand control


These extras can have a meaningful impact on your bottom line over time.
  * Some contractors build relationships with multiple suppliers to reduce risk


Reliable access to inventory keeps your crew moving and your customers happy.
  * Don’t just chase the lowest price — look for supplier reps who are invested in your success
  * A trusted supplier will help you grow, troubleshoot with you, and prioritize your jobs


The best equipment for your business is the one you can confidently sell, support, and stand behind — again and again.
When it comes to HVAC equipment, there’s no clear-cut champion — and that’s a good thing.
Some contractors stand by legacy brands like for their reputation and reliability. Others lean on , , or to take advantage of private label flexibility and supplier perks. And many put the focus entirely on their own , treating the equipment as just one part of the overall experience.
  * Having support when you need it — from the supplier and the manufacturer
  * Building a business that isn’t just selling boxes, but solving problems


The name on the unit matters far less than the experience your company delivers. Focus on what helps create consistent, high-quality installs — and the “best” brand will reveal itself.

You don’t have time to optimize every meta title or fix all the issues on your audit.
You just need visibility, and you need it now. No monkey business.
Well my friend, let me introduce you to Google Posts: Google’s simple tool for winning serious local results.
After reading this you’ll know how to use them, and why they’re so great for local .
Google Posts is a free tool for verified Google My Business profiles. It allows businesses to publish custom content directly from their GMB. They are temporary (only up for 7 days at a time) unless its an event or offer post with a start and end date.
  1. : Used to get the word out about a limited-time sale or promotion.
  2. : For promoting a specific product you are selling.
  3. : A way to get the word out about an event your business is hosting or promoting.
  4. : A simple update on your business, or changes customers should expect.


I won’t bore you with breaking down each post type and how to use them – it’s pretty straight forward. Instead, I’m going to walk through why Google Posts are a powerful tool for local SEO and how you can construct a post that wins.
The first thing you need is a compelling call to action. GMB actually built CTA buttons into each post type making it easier to convert users. Just select the CTA Type, and give it an appealing label.
Next, you need to align your post with where you are driving traffic. Are you sending them to a product page? Make sure your verbiage is the same. The post should feel like an extension of that product page – even using the same images if need be.
Its common knowledge that image content converts at a higher rate than simple text-based content. Adding an engaging image helps your post stand out, increasing its chance to convert. After you draw up your post it may seem like a tedious extra step, but I promise you its worth it.
Finally, use an active voice and speak with urgency. If your post sounds lame people are going to think your product or company is lame, and we don’t want that. Your message matters, so talk like it matters! If you want some killer copywriting tips, check out Brian Dean’s .
So what’s the big deal? Why does this simple posting feature for Google My Business have such a positive impact on local SEO?
The answer has everything to do with consumer behavior. The key to compelling user action is making an offer precisely when your customer realizes a need. People don’t want a solution to a problem they don’t have yet, and they don’t want to wait for a solution to a problem they do have!
This is where it gets cool – Google Posts have a knack for showing up in the right place at the right time.
Most post types are visible on both the SERP and Google Maps listings. When people have a need, they Google it. Sometimes users browse through options on Google Maps. Having an engaging post or offering visible on your GMB listing is one hell of an edge if your competitor decides to pass on it. It’s not just good for standing out from the competition – it actually can help you outrank local competition.
Don’t just take my word for it, according to a shared by Moz, GMB signals like Google Posts are the single most important ranking factor for local pack rankings. To put it more clearly, optimizing and using your GMB signals are more important than both linking and on-page optimization when it comes to besting your local competition in the SERPs.
Furthermore, the emphasis Google has placed on GMB optimization and usage has continued to rise, seeing a 32% increase in importance from 2017 to 2018.
Want to know how well your post is performing? Check Google Insights, It’s built right into your GMB account. Google Insights tracks what kind of searches your business is being found for, along with specific search queries and much more.
Did one of your posts not perform as well as you had hoped? Make another post, monitor its performance and keep experimenting. You probably won’t hit a post out of the park on your 1st try or even your 10th, but you’ll get the hang of it. Figure out what your users respond best to and move in that direction.
I know there’s some data junkies out there who are dying to set up post tracking in Google Analytics…
Unfortunately, Google Analytics doesn’t integrate with Google Insights. However, you can use UTM tracking codes to manually feed GA information from your Google Posts. It’s not all that difficult, but since you’re a busy small business owner I’m sure you don’t have the time for that . If you are interested, you should .
For real! Its really not that complicated, and you have everything you need to take a stab at it. You know your customer base better than anyone else and have the ability to make a very compelling post. Its free visibility that converts.
If you are interested in reading more about SEO for small businesses, ! I think you’ll find its full of practical information for everyday people like you and me.

We’ve built so many general contractor websites – but really still love to poke around and find other amazing sites that are out there. These sites (whether our designs or other website design companies) really demonstrate some excellent principles of effective and general aesthetics.
(In addition to these amazing contractor website examples – included beneath them are 7 tips to getting amazing results for your construction business.)
**Without further ado, 19 awesome examples of general contractor and construction websites!**
A huge piece of this project has been simplifying core messages, showing examples, and getting trust from visitors. The first version of the site made Spec7 look like a small un-trusted company, but this new version demonstrates that they work with tons of the highest caliber construction companies on their waterproofing needs.
We serve and home service companies with marketing + ! Check out our blog posts about , , , , and our , , , , and !
This renovation/design-focused realtor was a client of mine, and we did our best to take the absolute best of the best photographs they had from their interior decoration and design work and make them central to the site. Good photos and good are half the battle when making a website feel high end.
company website design, and multi-family company website design are not outside of our wheelhouse. In this case, this site is being built to showcase the area and the high-end details that are going into the construction of these properties. Our construction website design process goes into detail on who the ideal customer is, and in this case – the ideal customer wants everything taken care of, and in some cases, this is their 2nd or 3rd home. For that reason we built the structure of the site to amplify aspects of the condo’s to amplify elements that would help them feel ‘taken care of.’
Treasured Spaces is a client of ours at Hook Agency and we not only branded them (with the demographics of the 35-55-year-old housewife in search of an upgrade or renovation), but we created this sharp site that gives a ton of information for people looking for niche residential home building or project. From the 700+ words of information provided about basement , or the visual outline of the process from design to execution – we facilitate the prospective customer’s learning process and give Google what it wants and helped get Treasured Spaces major increases in rankings for the services they offer. If you’re curious, learn more about how we help our clients get more search engine traffic and increase revenue from digital leads 200%+ – check out our / Services.
This site was built from the very beginning with a heavier emphasis on the headlines, as we started with the copywriting first. We identified the ideal customers of this company as folks who cared about a healthy and wholesome lifestyle and their kids. For that reason, we drew out those aspects in the wording of things, and actually identified a few headlines that could be used in other marketing materials as well. We were particularly proud of “The Home is The Anchor of Your Family,” and some of the headlines that make this high-end, white-space infused construction company website look phenomenal.
Alpine Asphalt came to us with the simple request to modernize its I’ve had a lot of success helping get their websites looking professional, so I jumped at the chance. In the end, we came out with a site that showcases their positive reviews all over Google, Facebook, and Angie’s List – and provided the right information to customers so that they could get started.
QuickDry needed a website that represented them well to ideal customers and we are currently working through this design process with them. We identified their ideal customers, the reviews and organizations that will help people trust them, and the key pieces of information people would need to make a decision. Well-Designed water mitigation or disaster recovery websites will help people imagine themselves after they’ve been helped by your company. It’s not enough to tell them how awesome you are, you want them to identify with your current customers and imagine themselves in their shoes.
This site is currently in progress, and the filler text below shows where we are working with the business owner to get these pieces added. I’m extremely excited about the new look and how we might be able to show the professionalism and quality of work on their website that they previously haven’t. Just because you’re the best in town – doesn’t mean people can psychically find that out, they need proof, both with reviews and testimonials and other visual elements that speak to that quality and professionalism.
These might be one of the weaker examples on this list, but I do like the testimonials and the page dedicated to their process on this site. The AT Home Builder website design could also have some more content built out so that Google and other search engines have more information about what they sell. I suggest at least 700 words for the home page and each of the sub-services you offer.
Once again this site is a little thin on the content, but in this case, the visual aesthetic is striking. A video background shows plans being drawn and then turns into a frame and then a fleshed out building. The process demonstration feels unique and interesting and captures your attention.
From the photography to the icons that help communicate key points, Forensic Construction Consulting’s website is really a much higher caliber than most construction contractor websites and construction industry marketing web designs in general. Clean open visuals and high contrast between the text and the background make this site stand out among its peers.
Empowered Global might be a touch less modern than some of the other highlighted sites – but the message is clear about what they do, the phone number stands out at the top right of the design, and examples of their work are front and center and easy to get to. No matter how stylish your website is, what’s most important is the ease of use, the clarity of your message, and nudging people in the direction of the action you want them to take on your site.
I hope you enjoyed these awesome construction company, and general contractor websites – and got some ideas about how you might implement some of the things they do well on your . If you need any help with your construction company marketing or website design –  _check out our work and get a free consultation. Thanks!_
Having worked on 15+ construction and websites now, I’ve learned some things I think will help other designers – and possibly the owners of these companies or marketers working on their behalf.
Imagine for a second – that it’s not only your job to make the website look pretty, and showcase the work of the company well, but it’s your job to create an emotionally persuasive story in the site – and invite people to work with the company.
At the core of every designer’s is communication – and if you need to work on that brand story with a copywriter before getting down to work on the actual visual design of the site, that may be a smart place to get started.
Make sure to ask who their ideal customers are, and keep pushing until the scope is super tight. If they say 30-70-year-old working professionals with a 500k+ home. Say – if there were only a 5-year window for age, what age group would have the most ideal customers out of any.
The point is not to exclude people – the point is to aim.
If we aim super tightly, and really think about the psychology of a tightly defined group – then we’re more likely to appeal to people in general. Generalities and platitudes rarely are emotionally persuasive. But if you aimed at a 47-year-old mother with a husband that works ALL THE TIME and said “you have more on your plate than you thought you could ever handle – let us take remodeling off the ‘honey-do’ list, and into reality’ – imagine how that might resonate with 37-year-old men, and with 55-year-old women too!
This can be in simple ways, like making the big billboard photo of the website – an ideal customer of the company enjoying the benefits of the product or service.
I like to ask clients – “what’s that moment when the customer really starts to feel that they’ve made an amazing choice – going with your company? What are they doing at that time, usually? Are they looking out their window at a clean lawn, despite the fact they just saw 5 people replacing their roof, and removing all of their equipment?”
Try to get to the bottom of what those moments look like – physically, and tell that story with images as best as you can.
Nothing is more persuasive than a markedly different after photo, sitting next to a before photo that looks like the ideal client’s current situation. Find ways to ask for these from the people that can get them – and invite them to make this a consistent part of their process.
Ask the client – or leadership of the company, ‘What type of work is lucrative for you, and what type of work do you love.’
I’ve experienced a lot of construction companies say ‘we don’t need more work’, but I’ve never heard one say ‘we don’t want more ideal customers, or we can’t increase the quality of leads coming in off your site.
What do you do with all of this info? You make sure you showcase jobs like these.
Make the play button inviting – and sometimes use a still from the video in the visual design / UI of the site.
Nurturing visitors with related content is powerful because it both reminds them
Think about key places that will go with the flow, to invite people to work with the company. Some people are just coming to the site for this reason, so it’s OK to lead with it, and use verbiage like ‘get started,’ ‘get a free consultation,’ or ‘get a free estimate.’
The point is that there are very few secrets when it comes to creating an effective construction company website.
Find amazing examples on Awwwards, Behance, Dribbble and Pinterest, and trust yourself.
Big images, audience-focused headlines, and trust factors – these elements help your contractor website awesome.
  1. modern web design uses huge images of your best work, and happy customers. Don’t be shy – take up some space, people are used to scrolling vertically, the page doesn’t have to be short.
  2. Stop talking about yourself, and figure out what your ideal customers want and use that language in your headlines.
  3. You need to find ways to get people’s trust quickly, but more on that in the next section.


> “We’re all, necessarily, the hero of our own story” – Franz Kafka
**Trust is the number one biggest key to making an effective website.**
Can you help people trust your company quickly and easily?
  * A horizontal row of awards, certifications, places you have a high review average.


  1. Consider having a ‘get a quote’ or ‘start the conversation’ form at the top of each selling page.
  2. Get photos or videos of your ideal customers smiling in front of a completed project (and in the case of video) telling their story. Incorporate on every selling page.
  3. Have an icon or photo focused list right below the ‘billboard’ / top section of the website, so that people know the top services of the company quickly.
  4. Have an FAQ section on every selling page – using ‘show/hides’ addressing common questions that come up in the sales process.
  5. Make sure there is a contact or ‘get a quote’ button top right on every page to nudge visitors from around the site to take the next step, and remind them of the purpose of the website.


It pains me to say this – but there are 3 options for ‘website builders’ that will work for a construction company.
Although none of these are ideal (we love WordPress for real, and substantial reasons), you can definitely get started with a Wix website or Squarespace, start blogging, and get links back to your website (huge for Google visibility.)
Before you do any of this – Google My Business is the biggest weapon for local businesses that doesn’t even require you to have a website.
  * –for photography heavy websites with simple sleek design (not great for SEO.) 
  * – A ton of different templates, but with more options, often ends up looking unprofessional. 


We design from scratch, and then we do web development on WordPress so the site is easy for you and your team to edit and add new pages.
We tend to work with companies that have tried the cheap option, and now are ready to LOOK professional, give off a persuasive impression, actually gets leads.
Where visual design – and combine. We help contractors hook better leads, contact us now to get started!
Often contractors who are early in their business choose to go with a templated website design, but after when they’ve been in business a few years – decide to move onto something that’s custom for their business. The ideal is that a website tells your unique story, is built around your best images, and doesn’t look like any other competitors’ sites. Beyond website design – being visible on the web is by far the most important part of marketing yourself online.
Search engine optimization should be considered during your website design. How can you make sure your most lucrative services will be central to the website and get the right amount of content/ (a key ranking factor on Google.) Having your contact information central, being ideal customer-focused in your headlines, making sure your images are compelling, and making sure organizations/awards/testimonials give credibility and trust and help website visitors take the next step.
Companies should be aggressive about their marketing for more reasons than just getting new clients. Good marketing makes your current employees proud, it makes future ‘A Players’ easier to attract, and it makes your current customers feel like they made a great decision. For that reason – you should wrap your trucks, use yard signs or signage on job sites, be involved in local events, and certainly, you should be doing Search Engine Optimization, some paid advertisement as appropriate and social media marketing at least around your culture and/or before and after’s. What you focus on most is going to depend on your market, and what your key goals are – but these are a few ways to get started. The website, and creating happy customers to refer new business are central to everything you’ll do in marketing.
The first way is word of mouth and referrals – from there, growing construction companies will want to scale into two main forms of marketing. Brand marketing, and lead generation marketing. It really depends on the size that you want your company to grow and how much of a reputation you already have. We believe content marketing and are an easy way for growth-focused companies to get more out of their marketing dollars, and we help them save time and get leads with our aggressive approach. If you need SEO and premium professional web design – we’re a great option.
Most web design companies have a hard time creating websites that demonstrate an appropriate understanding of SEO. They cut corners because it’s easier to let the client dictate how a project should go rather than being a professional and making strong suggestions that will positively affect the mileage you get from your website. SEO is important during the build of contractor websites because you need to make strong suggestions for where to include more text (Google has to be able to read and understand what a page is about), and in the development process, there are all kinds of decisions being made that will affect the way Google indexes a page. Make sure you partner with a company that understands how Google reads the internet, not just a company that can make your website look pretty.
It really depends on what you feel a website could make you. A ‘business card’ style website might net a 3 million dollar construction company 10 leads a month – but what if a website could drive 20-30 leads a month instead? This is the kind of opportunity that drives smart contractors to seriously invest in their website design.

Niche marketing is far more successful than other types of marketing because it means that you’ll have a more focused search when completing marketing tasks. For electricians, niche markets might look like new construction, residential construction, , residential , commercial , and so on.
You might decide on one or two of these niche markets to developed and cultivate more. This doesn’t mean that you need to turn down work in other niches, it just means that you won’t be actively marketing to jobs that are outside your niche.
When choosing a niche you can choose what your company is better at, enjoy more, turn a better profit, or any other factors.
After you have developed and done business within your niche you’ll need to actively seek out reviews. Potential customers will enjoy seeing reviews from your previous customers that relate to them. There are several places that you can receive reviews such as Google My Business, Yelp, Facebook, and more. Using those reviews on your website is another great way to receive credibility.
If you’re having trouble getting reviews naturally, don’t be afraid to ask customers. After all, who doesn’t want honest feedback both good or bad?
Google offers a free listing for every business that wants to be listed. Whether you’re a small shop or a huge company, they offer you a listing so that you can show any potential customers your contact info, hours, and other things. If you don’t know how to get this set up, then take a look at .
Google My Business is essential if you want to be found in “near me” searches. When someone searches “ near me” you should be showing up! Google My Business is also a great place for people to review you. If you have the service all set up then potential customers will be able to see your average reviews along with all of your general business information.

  *   *   * 

Running a solid business is one thing — but turning it into a growth machine takes something more. It’s not just about doing great work or hiring a few extra techs. It’s about building something bigger than yourself.
If you’re just counting on “good service” to carry your business into the next level, you’re going to get stuck. Because the reality is: great customer service is the bare minimum these days — not your competitive advantage.
> _“We’re a $4 trillion industry… enough to change the world. And the trades own that.”_
That kind of mindset shift is where real scaling begins. You’re not just selling services — you’re building an asset that creates opportunity for your team, your family, and your community.
Let’s break down how to grow a heating and air conditioning business step by step — from the backend systems to the front-end sales strategy.
**Before you scale, get clear on what you’re building — and why.**
You can’t grow what you haven’t defined. One of the biggest mistakes make is chasing growth without first deciding what success looks like.


Your goals will shape everything from who you hire to how you price your jobs.
If your model leans heavily on service calls, you’ll need to build for operational efficiency and tight scheduling. If you’re install-focused, that may mean doubling down on sales training and same-day fulfillment. Both can scale — but they require different systems.


Whether you’re using flat-rate pricing, good/better/best packages, or a digital quoting tool — make it consistent and easy to say yes to.
The best companies train their team to price with confidence, not discounts — and use promotions or financing to make high-ticket jobs more accessible without hurting margins.
**You can’t scale chaos. You need systems that run with or without you.**
If you’re looking to grow beyond the “owner-operator” phase, operations is where you need to level up. Even the best marketing and sales strategy will fall flat if your backend is messy, manual, or unreliable.
Think about it this way: when your techs are showing up late, paperwork is getting lost, and customers aren’t getting follow-ups — you’re losing trust money. The HVAC businesses that scale smoothly are the ones that prioritize efficiency and eliminate guesswork early on.
Relying on paper invoices or manual scheduling might feel familiar — but it’s costing you time, money, and opportunities.
Top HVAC companies are turning to tech that helps them:
  * → Try: , , 


These tools aren’t just nice-to-haves — they’re game-changers for saving time, boosting efficiency, and creating a better customer experience.
When techs show up on time, have the right info, and close the loop quickly, it builds trust and leads to more five-star reviews. Customers notice when your business feels modern and professional — and they reward it with referrals and repeat work.
Growth isn’t just about doing more — it’s about doing more 
If every tech has a different way of quoting, every CSR handles calls differently, and no one follows up the same way twice… that’s a problem. You’re not scaling a business — you’re creating daily fires to put out.


Start by documenting your best tech’s process. Then train everyone to follow it. Systems create stability — and stability creates confidence in your leadership.
> _“I needed to learn how to delegate. That’s what caused our growth. You’ve got to hire around your weaknesses.”_
The moment you stop being the bottleneck is the moment growth gets easier.
You can’t improve what you’re not measuring — and in HVAC, the right metrics will tell you exactly where your business is leaking revenue.


These numbers reveal patterns and help you coach your team more effectively. They also give you the confidence to make bigger moves — like hiring, expanding into new markets, or investing in new tools — without flying blind.
**Your business is only as good as the people carrying it out. Build a team that wants to win.**
Not just warm bodies to fill a van. Not just someone who “knows a guy” in the trades. But driven, coachable team members who want to grow their skills, earn a great living, and contribute to something bigger than themselves.
If you want to grow your business, you’ve got to start thinking like a recruiter — not just a technician or owner.
People don’t just leave jobs — they leave bad leadership, unclear expectations, and companies that make them feel replaceable.
  * Be the kind of leader someone wants to build their life around


When people feel like they’re just cogs in a machine, they burn out fast. But when they’re part of a mission, they show up with energy.
> _“Can you imagine taking someone who was living out of his car and helping him become a husband, a father, and a top performer? That’s the kind of transformation we aim for.”_
That’s not just inspiring — it’s a serious retention strategy.
Here’s the truth: if you’re only hiring when you’re desperate, you’re already behind.
  * Make recruiting part of their brand and social media presence



Don’t just hand out business cards. Snap a selfie, text it to them, and invite them to do a ride-along — like Tommy does. Make it memorable.
Growth becomes easier when you’re not constantly scrambling to hire from outside.
  * Create training tracks for techs, CSRs, installers, and sales roles
  * Identify high performers early — and give them the tools to lead


When people see that growth is possible , they stop looking elsewhere. They stick around. They contribute more. And your business gets stronger from the inside out.
**The fastest-growing companies aren’t just operationally sound — they’re built on belief.**
At some point, growth isn’t just about tactics or tools — it’s about Culture isn’t a breakroom poster or a pizza party. It’s how your team shows up every day when no one’s watching.
The best HVAC companies — the ones hitting $10M, $50M, or even $100M+ — aren’t just working harder. They’ve created a high-performance culture that turns goals into standards and teammates into leaders.
If you want a team that cares, show them you care first.
  * Taking the time to train and coach — not just correct
  * Modeling the work ethic, communication, and mindset you expect from others


> _“I tell my team — pull your shoulders back, smile, look people in the eye. If you don’t love yourself, you’re never going to make it. Not as a salesperson. Not as an owner.”_
Leadership isn’t just about driving results. It’s about building people who drive results.
Want better performance? Stop training for the bare minimum. Start developing people like they’re future leaders — because some of them are.
  * Use LMS platforms () to reinforce standards


And remember — your top people aren’t always obvious on paper. Sometimes, the person getting overlooked in the call center today could be your next ops manager. Invest in the humans behind the tools.
The best cultures don’t tolerate inconsistency — they Every position in your company should come with clear expectations, playbooks, and accountability measures.
And when someone underperforms? You address it directly — not a year later during a review, but in the moment.
> _“If you take more than you give, you’ve got to go,”_ says Katherine Howard of Lee’s Air. _“Because I have hundreds of people who depend on me to fill their bank account on payday — and if you’re not doing your job, someone else will.”_
That level of ownership creates trust. It creates momentum. And it creates a team that to level up — not just survive.
People don’t stay where they feel stuck. Create energy by showing your team where they’re winning and where they’re growing.
  * Set team-wide goals and update progress visibly (whiteboards, dashboards, etc.)


Growth is contagious. When one person levels up, others follow. That’s how culture becomes your competitive edge.
**You can’t grow if no one knows who you are. Visibility drives opportunity.**
If you’re serious about scaling your HVAC business, marketing can’t be an afterthought — it has to be a core part of your growth strategy. You can have the best team, the cleanest installs, and the tightest operations, but if customers aren’t finding you, it’s all for nothing.
Effective marketing isn’t just about “getting your name out there.” It’s about building trust before a customer ever picks up the phone. The companies that win are the ones who consistently show up, deliver value, and make it easy for people to say yes.
Before you dive into ads or fancy branding, start by dominating your local search results. Most HVAC customers aren’t browsing Instagram — they’re Googling “AC repair near me” from their phone when the system breaks.
  * This is the most important real estate in local search — especially for mobile users.
  * Ask after every job. A steady stream of 5-star feedback builds credibility and boosts your rank.
  * Your hours, service area, and contact details should match across Yelp, Facebook, Nextdoor, and other directories.
  * Post updates, project photos, promos, and employee shoutouts regularly to keep your profiles looking alive and engaged.


Local is an ongoing effort, not a one-and-done task — but the who commit to it dominate their zip codes.
Your website is more than a digital brochure — it’s your 24/7 sales rep. And in today’s market, you only get one shot to make a good impression.
  * Clearly states what you do and where you do it
  * Makes it easy to call, text, or schedule with zero confusion
  * Includes real reviews, certifications, and guarantees to build trust fast


Pro tip: Don’t just talk about features — explain Customers don’t care about the SEER rating unless you tell them it means lower energy bills and more comfort in the summer.
Once you’ve built a strong local and web presence, paid ads can fuel faster growth — as long as they’re managed wisely.
  * These appear above all other listings and only charge you for qualified leads — perfect for HVAC.
  * Target high-intent keywords to show up when people are actively looking for HVAC help.
  * Great for brand awareness, retargeting website visitors, and promoting limited-time offers or seasonal tune-ups.


The key is to track performance obsessively. Every ad should have a dedicated call tracking number and a clear conversion goal. If you don’t know what’s working, you can’t double down — and you’re probably wasting money.
Your techs are more than just service providers — they’re walking, talking brand ambassadors.
Create a culture where your team is proud to represent the company. That pride turns into:


You can systemize this, too. Make it part of your ride-alongs or daily huddles:
  * Post highlights of happy customers or shoutouts to team members
  * Train techs to ask for a Google review 


In a world where people trust people more than logos, turning your team into your brand might just be your biggest marketing advantage.
**If you don’t know your numbers, you’re not running a business — you’re flying blind.**
Growth without financial clarity is a recipe for burnout. You can have trucks on the road, phones ringing, and jobs closing… but if your profit margins are thin or your overhead is bloated, you’ll feel like you’re sprinting in place.
The most successful HVAC companies treat their data like a dashboard — not a rearview mirror. They don’t just look at what happened last month. They use live numbers to make real-time decisions that drive growth forward.
Forget vanity metrics. Focus on the ones that tell you how healthy and scalable your business really is:
  * – Are you charging enough to cover labor, materials, and overhead?
  * – Sales performance at the technician level
  * – Are your marketing dollars pulling their weight?
  * – How much does it take to get a booked job?


The point isn’t to drown in spreadsheets. It’s to build a simple scorecard — and actually use it.
Hiring a new tech? Launching a new service? Opening a second location?
Before you decide, run the numbers. Can your current average ticket and closing rate support another van? Is your profit margin strong enough to absorb a slower winter? If not, you’re setting yourself up for stress — not scale.
> _“I can tell you everything about your business with just a few KPIs. Average ticket. Closing rate. Booking rate. Cost per lead. That’s all I need.”_
Simple, powerful, and true. These numbers tell the story of whether your growth is profitable — or just expensive.
Do you know how much work you need to break even each month? What about how much your business do with your current team and trucks?
Too many owners chase growth without knowing where the ceiling is. Others are profitable but playing small because they’ve never done the math on what’s truly possible.
  * – How many jobs your current crew can realistically complete per day/week/month
  * – Are you getting $500K–$750K+ in annual production per tech? If not, why?


These numbers give you confidence. They also tell you when it’s time to , , or 
**You can go fast alone — but if you want to go far, you’ll need help.**
Even the most driven HVAC business owners hit ceilings. Whether it’s in leadership, operations, or marketing, there comes a point when personal hustle isn’t enough to keep growing.
That’s why the smartest owners don’t try to scale in isolation. They surround themselves with people who’ve already done what they’re trying to do — and they tap into those insights before making the next big move.
You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Thousands of HVAC contractors are out there solving the same problems you are — often with smarter systems and sharper tools.
Whether it’s a mastermind group, a local contractor association, or a national coaching program, the key is to:


  * – A growing community of operators focused on high performance and tactical execution.
  * – Great for sharpening sales skills, overcoming objections, and building elite technician training systems.
  * – One of the most established peer networks, offering coaching, systems, and buying power for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical contractors.


The truth is, you’ll grow faster by learning from someone else’s hard-earned lessons than by making every mistake yourself. Don’t let pride or isolation hold you back.
You’ll grow faster by learning from someone else’s hard-earned lessons than by making every mistake yourself.
The best insights don’t always come from books — they come from shop tours, one-on-one calls, and real conversations with business owners who’ve already walked the path.
> _“You want to make your company better? Go out and find the best company in your industry. Fly across the country if you have to. Ask 100 questions. You’ll walk into the building and the air will feel different.”_
Seeing what’s possible up close can completely shift your ceiling. Don’t settle for guessing when you can see greatness firsthand.
As your business grows, so will your options. But growth capital and partnerships come with strings — and not all deals are created equal.


  * Will this make us more profitable — not just bigger?


Great deals accelerate momentum. Bad ones drain energy and distract you from what matters. Make sure any move aligns with your not just your short-term goals.
Real growth isn’t just about more jobs or more trucks — it’s about building a business that can scale without breaking.


And in today’s market, . The best systems and services don’t mean much if the right customers can’t find you.

We can all tell a great website when we see it: it’s orderly, professional and encourages users to hang around and discover more about the organization. However, that doesn’t guarantee that your site visitors will automatically consider using your . For most residential construction companies, your website is your window of opportunity to make more sales. Most potential clients will come across your site from Google or Yelp, but it’s your content that will assure them that your services are worth their time.
But first, watch us give some in this video:
Many in the construction business miss business growth opportunities because they lack alignment between marketing and sales. You may be investing your time and effort into branded collateral, trade shows and your social media, but your marketing may not be converting any new leads. The following strategies will help you get new leads and a leg up on your competition.
**Here are the first five things we suggest – but check out the**
Most people look to experts for engaging content. Develop a blog about your residential construction business accessible from your website. A continuous flow of new and engaging content will move your website toward the top of search engine results pages. If you try to invest in construction lead generation without developing your unique content, you will always attract low-quality leads. Engaging content will make your prospects feel like they are making intelligent decisions for their construction solutions. 
  * – Before and after photos can be a real deal-breaker for new prospects.


  * – An excellent way to stay on top of the marketing curve. How-to’s, FAQs, and educational videos are easy to create and add value to your market.


  * – Featured projects are a perfect way of showing and explaining to your prospects how you handle your projects and the outcomes you deliver to your customers.
  * – This content will assist in educating your market and also helps them in the process of decision-making.


Since you already know your niche, the next thing is putting that knowledge to use. If you are carrying out remodeling work in a certain neighborhood, try placing locally targeted advertisements in as many places as you can – social media, Google ads, or even on more traditional billboards. When selecting a construction firm: potential customers will want to ascertain that you have done some great work previously. They want a brand they can trust.
Some ways that you can rev up your advertising efforts include:
  * Upgrade Your Website: A can boost your credibility with potential clients and it can show that your business is legit. Don’t scare away potential leads with an unorganized website. 


  * Pay-Per-Click: Pay-per-click is a paid marketing strategy that is a great way to speed up the lead-generation process when done well. PPC allows advertisers to pay to show up under terms that customers are already searching for


Call your clients, prospects, or referral sources each week instead of leaving messages. You can also create time to meet several prospects, clients, and referral sources in-person once a week. Try using Remodelers AutoPilot app to help you stay in touch with your former customers, leads, and prospects. By staying in contact with them, you will keep your construction company fresh in their minds and open new opportunities for yourself.
Carry out some analysis and select one section of the construction market to concentrate on. If you narrow your focus on a single market, you can generate content specifically for that market. Once you make relevant content, your users are in a better position to connect with your offer. Moreover, having this focus enables you and your firm to focus on those clients and projects that are more rewarding, more enjoyable, more profitable and less stressful.
Being available means that all your channels of communication are open, and there’s someone available and ready to take the calls of your customers and prospective buyers at all times. Do not allow your email account to remain messy with unread messages or your Twitter account to waste away. Your fast and timely response means that your clients will be glad you can solve their construction problems quickly and it will lead to better reviews and an upper hand on your competition.
Regardless of the strategies you decide to push on, sticking to your plan until it becomes a habit will guarantee your success. Habits often take effort to maintain, but they produce great results in the long run. So have a plan, stick to it, and you will get more leads than you can handle.
**You’ve gone to extreme lengths to form your company into something you’re proud of. You do excellent work, you’ve poured your blood, sweat, and tears into it – and now it’s time to grow.**
Don’t let fate decide – you’ll need to push the in the same way that you pushed to get the work out of your team. Sometimes this means putting ‘sweat equity’ into your marketing – meaning your own time, and _potentially allocating resources to the best possible options for getting more leads for ._ Experiment with these ideas to find the right balance of value and how much resources they take to implement.
If you can narrow down the number of people you’re targeting your sales efforts at – their becomes efficiency in your marketing efforts. It’s also likely that your expertise in that particular industry goes up as you do more jobs within it. Imagine giving a particular kind of client (Apartment buildings) the last four jobs you’ve done, and they are all apartment buildings – you’re much more likely to get more leads for people looking for that particular type of work.
All it takes is to create a write-up outlining terms and create a place to sign for both parties. If you specialize in a very specific industry it makes it a lot easier to reach out to people you know to say, “If you ever get [these types of projects] we specialize in them and are willing to offer a 10%, $1,000, or whatever’s appropriate referral fee to any project you refer that we land.”
If you have something specific, in writing and ready to shoot off to other people in your industry, or in adjacent industries – you’ll not only have a solid sales tool but an attractive offer. An offer you can use to market yourself to new companies and individuals you previously didn’t have a great reason to reach out.
If your company has been around for a while, you may be tempted to rest on your laurels when it comes to the ways you get new leads – but this is a recipe for having fewer excuses if there’s ever a dry spell.
Make it a point to reach out to former employees, bosses, or work colleagues – particularly if they went on to start a different business. This is a good reason not to burn bridges as word gets around, and particularly when it comes to commercial work, the amount of people connected starts to be less and less with more and more influence.
For this reason you should always keep relationships open, bring former employees or bosses out to lunch and consider giving some clear referral terms for when they come across someone who needs your specialty 
I cannot endorse Business Networking International, any chamber of commerce, or any ‘Business to Business’ networking group for that matter – but I do suggest you consider testing them out. Particularly if the B2B groups near you allow visiting 1 or 2 times, I’d say visit them all!
The weekly meetings are difficult because the time it takes to go to them is high, only for the hope of some leads months from now. If you’re anything like me, you like to focus your efforts on things that have a high-return without spending crazy amounts of time each month.
This should be and is a somewhat high expense at the beginning of lead-generation tactics. If you try to scrimp on this step of the process though, you may find yourself wondering why the leads aren’t rolling in on a regular basis.
Just like construction can be done in a low-value and low-quality way, there are thousands of companies out there that are selling low-quality websites. Our specialty is creating -friendly websites for construction companies that look professional and stylish, meaning they are built to get traffic from Google, AND they aren’t an eyesore.
There are many companies that do . I just encourage you to make this one of your more foundational lead generation sources, rather than glossing over it and trying to slap a coat of varnish on the top of a poorly and cheaply made website.
Great example of both niching and a commercial construction case study
Not only do you showcase your expertise to anyone who gets to your website via a search engine or social media channel – but you can increase the value by sharing the post and pictures on social media as well through Instagram, a Facebook Page, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
Putting out content regularly on your website should be a high priority – and ideally, it’s teamed up with social media marketing and link-building efforts, so that the hard work you or the company doing your SEO is putting into content is getting found on Google and other search engines and social media.
Reviews are so underrated I almost put the value at 100%. By themselves they aren’t much – and although places like Houzz and will push you to get reviews on their platform they only really help your efforts on that one platform and people already using it. I wouldn’t begrudge anyone of any lead generation tactic, although I’ve seen some pretty discouraging things about the way Home Advisor makes you sign away the usage of your brand name and is often ranking above companies for their own name on Google and . Usually, these leads get sold to many other companies as well, and everyone is paying HomeAdvisor, but only one gets the job.
Point being is the way I push clients to get reviews revolves around places that get featured in Google search results pages. So Facebook and native Google reviews have the most visibility in this regard, and I suggest creating a rhythm around asking happy clients for reviews after you’ve completed a job.
It can require a couple of nudges, and may include giving them some bullet points you want to mention (they’ll often ask for this).
Depending on the region you’re in there will be construction industry gatherings, which can be round-tables, networking events, or just pure fun. If you haven’t been to a few of these, it may be a great place to increase the amount of connections you have, and prepare your mindset for bigger jobs.
Often these kinds of events are rife with companies that have been around the block and can share some insight into the current challenges of the industry – or even the types of work you may want to avoid. If some of your work is earned working through other companies, these kinds of events may be the ideal way to rub shoulders with other company owners who may want to hire you as well.
Create the lead generation frameworks that will serve you in good and bad economic times
because of the higher bar for earning these types of jobs. Many companies have to cut their teeth on smaller projects first and earn a reputation and work examples before they get the opportunity to bid for higher value jobs.
Don’t get discouraged – but do specialize if you can, and find ways to be useful and available to your fellow construction industry comrades, while positioning yourself as the expert in your community. Whether the economy is good, or the leads are slowing to a trickle – continually refresh your systems for getting more and set yourself up for success in the future.
The basics of helping people find you are somewhat simple – you need new, useful content and landing pages on your website that are targeted for specific terms people are Googling, you need to get more links back to your site from around the web because it helps Google know they relative importance of your site, and you need to find strategic ways to pay for visibility on Google remarketing, and Facebook promoted posts.
You don’t need to hire someone like me to do your marketing, it’s just that marketing experts (particularly ones that have specialized in construction marketing) will allow you to move more quickly on these types of strategies, and allow you to spend more time on what you’re best at – running your construction business.
Working with a lead generation company that knows your industry in and out can significantly improve your chances of turning on the lead flow, much more so than a large corporation like HomeAdvisors or Houzz. Because a lead-generation or SEO company like Hook Agency works with you and ONLY YOU in your area. We create exclusive partnerships for a particular service and don’t take any new clients in that area – then help create content and get links back to your site from around the web – the two biggest pieces that help with getting higher on Google. We also know how to help you get more phone calls and contact form submissions by making tweaks in your website design – this process is called ‘Conversion Rate Optimization,’ and we’ve seen amazing construction company owners who have told us “we are getting so many leads, we don’t even know what to do with them all.” Send us a message today if you’d like to move towards that kind of future.
Does your name and brand/logo say what you want it to about the quality of work you do? You may think it doesn’t matter but does your ideal customer care? The data would say that they do. A group of women er polled and asked if the aesthetic of a website would drive them away if it was done poorly – and 73% of them said it could. They said they would ‘click away’ if they felt the look of the website reflected poorly on the quality of the company. Just the look of your companies marketing can attract or repel. The name matters as well – Advertising magnate Ogilvy puts it this way “What’s in a brand name? Perhaps everything, or at the very least a brand’s identity – its personality, values, recognition, and reputation. It differentiates you from your competitors and gets customers interested or at least curious. The name is not the brand, but a shortcut to the brand promise. Sometimes, the brand name is so apt and describes what it does so well that customers call all similar products by the same name. Google is the universal term for internet searches, Saran Wrap in the US for all plastic cling film and Hoover in the UK for all vacuum cleaners, and as a verb to describe the process.
If you’re still not sure then apply these 5 tests to check your brand out. Is it short and easy to understand, remember, pronounce and spell? Does it use figurative language that creates the imagery you want? Does it resonate with your target? Does it stand out, or can it be confused with other brands? Can it be shortened or abbreviated in an acceptable way?
Customers build brands, not companies. They give brands value by developing perceptions and expectations for those brands. Your brand name is shortcut to these associations. A brand name should be easily remembered, catchy, explain what your product does as well as communicate the message you want to send. What does your name say about you?

  *   *   * 

Imagine a homeowner searching “emergency plumber near me” or “best repair in [your city].” Where do they look first? If your business isn’t showing up at the top, you’re missing real opportunities.
is the art and science of making sure your business is highly visible when people are ready to buy. It’s not about vanity metrics or “looking good online” — it’s about being found by real customers in your area, right when they need you most.
  * A top spot with strong reviews makes your business look credible at a glance.
  * If you’re not ranking, your competitors are — and they’re getting the calls.
  * Investing in local SEO strengthens your foundation and compounds results over time.


If you want to be the first call in your area, ranking high on Google Maps isn’t a nice-to-have — it’s essential. Putting real investment into Google Maps is one of the smartest moves your business can make to consistently attract better leads, build trust fast, and stay ahead of the competition.
Local search isn’t just a trend — it’s how homeowners find the help they need, right when they need it. Whether it’s a broken AC in the middle of July or a leaking pipe at midnight, people aren’t flipping through the Yellow Pages anymore. 
Homeowners expect fast answers, and they trust that the businesses Google shows them first are the ones worth calling. That means if you’re not showing up in those critical moments, you’re not even in the running.
Here’s why local search should be non-negotiable for any serious business:
> **“80% of U.S. consumers search online for local businesses every week, and 32% do it daily.”** — 
Think about that for a second: every single day, a third of your potential customers are actively looking for a local business to hire. And if they don’t find you, they’re hiring someone else.
Not only are people searching constantly, but almost half of all activity on Google is geared toward finding local businesses:
And if you think searches are just a passing phase, think again. Take a look at how much interest in “near me” searches has exploded over the last decade:
**Searches containing “near me” have skyrocketed over the past 12 years, reflecting a massive shift in how consumers find local businesses.** If your business isn’t optimized for local search, you’re missing out on a tidal wave of high-intent customers who are ready to call or visit.
Local search has become the new word-of-mouth — only faster, bigger, and way more competitive.
If you’re not showing up where it matters most, it’s not just a missed opportunity — it’s lost revenue, fewer leads, and slower business growth. When homeowners search, you don’t want to be the company they find.
Showing up isn’t optional anymore. **It’s the price of admission if you want to compete and win in 2025 and beyond.**
It’s no secret that when homeowners need something fast — a plumber, an , an repair tech — they aren’t digging through endless websites. **They’re pulling up Google Maps and picking from the top businesses that show up.**
Google Maps has become the default tool for local discovery. It’s fast, trusted, and easy for consumers to compare options instantly.
> **“72% of consumers use Google Search, and 51% use Google Maps to find information about local businesses.”** — 
If your business isn’t showing up strong on Maps, you’re leaving half the market wide open for your competitors. Homeowners don’t scroll past the top few listings — they want someone who’s nearby, highly rated, and ready to help.
And here’s the kicker: these aren’t passive browsers — they’re action-takers.
> **“76% of consumers who search for ‘near me’ visit a business within a day.”** — 
That means if you’re ranking high on Google Maps, you’re not just getting more eyeballs — you’re getting more calls, more visits, and more booked jobs.
When someone needs emergency HVAC repair or urgent help, they’re not making a spreadsheet of options — they’re clicking the first or second listing that looks credible.
If you’re serious about dominating your local market, you can’t afford to ignore where today’s customers are making their decisions.
It’s one thing to show up on Google Maps — it’s another to turn that visibility into real revenue.
When your business ranks high and looks trustworthy, the impact on performance is massive.
Visibility on the Map Pack — that prime real estate at the top of search results — directly drives action:
> **“42% of local searches result in clicks on the Google Map Pack.”** — 
That’s nearly half of all local searchers making a decision right there. No scrolling, no second-guessing. They see the top listings, they click, and they take action.
**If you’re in the Map Pack, you’re in the money. If you’re not, you’re invisible.**
But showing up isn’t enough on its own — getting found is just the first step. What people see when they find you is what really seals the deal.
If a homeowner pulls up your listing and sees poor reviews (or worse, no reviews at all), it’s an instant red flag. They don’t know you personally — they’re trusting your reputation online to make their decision.
> **“93% of consumers say online reviews affect their buying decisions.”** — 
When a homeowner sees a business with a ton of 5-star reviews and another with no reviews or low ratings, **they’re going with the business that feels safer and more credible every single time.**
They build trust instantly and remove hesitation, especially for where reliability, speed, and professionalism are top priorities.
  * If you want the calls, you need to look trustworthy.


Google Maps SEO isn’t just about getting found — it’s about being the obvious, no-brainer choice once you are.
At the end of the day, it all comes down to results: How much more business are you getting for the money you put in?
The numbers behind local SEO — and Google Maps optimization specifically — make it one of the highest-ROI marketing moves a home service business can make.
Compare that to traditional outbound methods like door-to-door sales or flyer drops — great for building brand recognition, but not always targeted to homeowners actively looking for help right now. Local SEO doesn’t just bring in more leads — it brings in better, higher-intent leads who are already searching for exactly what you offer.
Even better, when you invest strategically into local SEO (and not just dabble), the returns can be massive:
> **“40% of local SEO campaigns achieve a 500% or better ROI.”** — 
**A well-run strategy could easily return five times what you spend on it.** And once you start ranking high and locking in trust with great reviews, the momentum keeps building — making every future call or booking even cheaper to acquire.
Strong Google Maps SEO is like setting up a permanent billboard in your customer’s pocket — one that shows up when they actually need you.
  * You’re not fighting for fleeting attention like social media ads.
  * You’re showing up exactly when a homeowner needs to hire someone 


Smart home service companies aren’t asking if they should invest in Google Maps SEO. They’re asking how fast they can ramp it up.
There’s no getting around it: 
It’s not just about claiming your business listing and hoping for the best. If you want to dominate your market, you need to put in the time, the effort, and yes, the money.
  * Optimizing your profile, adding photos, posting updates, responding to reviews, and keeping everything accurate — all of it demands ongoing attention.
  * Gathering real customer reviews, building local citations, creating location-specific website content, and maintaining consistency across the web.
  * Working with a proven local SEO expert to fine-tune your strategy, manage technical details, and maximize your rankings.


Doing it right isn’t free — but compared to the upside, 
When you invest in Google Maps SEO, you’re setting yourself up for:
  * who are ready to book now.
  * from better-qualified leads who already trust what they see online.
  * in your local area, making you the go-to name people remember.
  * — the more you show up, the more reviews you earn, the stronger your presence becomes.


Instead of chasing cold leads, you’re building a system where the best customers come looking for you.
Unlike ads that stop the second you quit paying, a strong Google Maps presence keeps working for you 24/7 — driving calls, leads, and booked jobs month after month.
The upfront investment might feel big. 
If you’re serious about growing your business, 
Going cheap on Google Maps SEO usually means half-baked strategies, outdated tactics, and poor results that waste your time and money. Worse, it leaves the door wide open for a competitor who invest properly to outrank you and take the leads that could have been yours.
When it comes to winning in your local market, **investing in Google Maps SEO isn’t optional — it’s essential.** Homeowners are searching online now more than ever, making fast decisions based on who they see first and trust most.
**If you’re not showing up strong on Google Maps, you’re losing calls to competitors who are.**
A powerful, optimized presence backed by real reviews turns visibility into booked jobs — and serious growth.
Of course, every business is different. Your service area, competition, and goals should shape how aggressive you go. But whether you’re just starting out or scaling up, doing nothing (or going cheap) isn’t an option anymore.


Businesses that treat Google Maps SEO like a real investment are the ones getting the calls, closing the jobs, and winning the market. If you’re ready to stop missing out, about how we can help you own your local area.

## Page: https://hookagency.com/blog/home-advisor-reviews

  *   *   * 

Construction companies are finding canceling their service with Home Advisor is difficult – and when savvy business owners have reviewed them with a video about it – **home advisor offered them a refund, essentially a bribe of over $1,000 to take it down.**
So you be the judge – is Home Advisor Pro a scam?
**This article will give you everything you need to know about Home Advisor – if it’s legit, and if you should use it.**
**We are not able to get your money back from Home Advisor.**
**We’re a marketing agency that curated a bunch of reviews of Home Advisor to show you you’re not the only one they’ve scammed.**
**This person is in lawn services – and says you need spend money to make money:**
  * Other niches that seem to do well on there: Handymen, Pool services, Sewer repair, building ponds, excavation, and some general contractors.
  * Many – many other niches have had terrible experiences, and that’s why this post focuses mainly on those negative experiences. We work with a lot of roofers, HVAC, plumbers and have seen a lot of mad contractors.


Some of the niches we serve: & , & , & , &. We also drive leads for all kinds of , including , , , and .
There are several different perspectives in this article from very savvy people – and you won’t want to miss any of it.
This is for the people that have been scammed by Home Advisor.
Because sites like this don’t monitor themselves – and even collaborate with people like Better Business Bureau to get taken seriously, despite un-ethical business practices. Let’s see how long it takes them to change their name (like they’ve done before.)
This brave business owner decided to keep up the video – and get’s down to talk about Home Advisor’s GlassDoor reviews (reviews from employees for the previous employer) that talk about the fact that ServiceMagic has 100’s of lawsuits.
You tell me – does changing your name over and over again mean you’re proud of your reputation?
How do you have an A+ Rating on Better Busines Bureau with 86% negative reviews?!
A couple somewhat telling Home Advisor reviews from Better Business Bureau (these are the last three from business owners)–
> This company is a scam. I have been using them for several months for the company I work for and I have always had problems with leads that do not answer the phone or respond to voicemails and emails. The number of these has been growing on a monthly basis and I am very upset as I have lost so much money! I have had people hang up, tell me they never were on Home Advisor, or they were just on their site and not wanting to talk to companies..This company is a complete scam so to all companies out there.. beware and stay away. They don’t even want to try and work with you, they just say sorry we don’t credit for unanswered calls… we have an excellent coordinator calling, emailing and all else… too many bad leads. I hope others are aware of and end business with them as well. Be warned that they now own ******* **** and ********* as well. I wish I could give 0 stars!
> Homeadvisor is an expert company in ripping off businesses. * They lack good follow up and customer service – when you submit a complain nobody gets back to you. * They charge you for services that you have not enrolled and for leads that you are unable to address like if you get a lead at 2 am in the morning you better get up from you sleep and call otherwise when morning calls you will have no chance. * Anyone in the company can sign up for their service but to cancel you need a background check and the owner has to call. * They don’t explain their services properly and deceive you about how to go around it just to get you sign. At the end of the month you will have no profits and just a big bill to pay them. I would not recommend them and would find a different way to market the business and find lead sources.
> We have had many issues over the years with HA not issuing credit on FAKE or WRONG numbers or just outright bad contact information. To Home Adviser, they still view this as a LEAD and have rejected countless requests for credits even when we have a “number that has been recently disconnected.” This is BAD BUSINESS. I have spoke with many other AC that have these same issues. After 3 years of fighting these issues, we are done and will be moving our business else where, I’m tired of fighting these credits. I also find it silly of them to loose $6,000 / year on a $20 credit. I guess this also show’s how they conduct business poorly. So much for the customer is always right.Home Adviser promotes good business strategies through their review platform, but they do not abide by the same rules. More of us need to call them out on this. Google “Home Advisor, FAKE LEADS” what you will see following that will blow your mind and make you think twice about using their services.
Given – some employees just might be sore for being fired. Employees talk about management, encouraging them to lie in order to sell – which is crazy. Check out the GlassDoor Reviews. The video above talks about contractors getting sold leads for jobs that weren’t even in their state, and for a period of time, they weren’t giving them a refund on those leads.
**What about Homeowners – how do they feel about HomeAdvisor?**
I can speak as a Search Engine Optimization specialist – if another company can rank for your companies name and then sell the leads back to you, you’re getting a raw deal. HomeAdvisor makes you sign the right for them to use your brand name in their materials and pages on their site – which essentially could take away customers that would have just come to your website and become a lead in the first place. 
Can you think about the lunacy of that for a second?
You can imagine – if you get 15 leads, and every single one of those is going to a bunch of other companies – you don’t have an advantage.
The customer didn’t express interest in you as a provider, which isn’t ideal. It’s much better to get a lead from your website or another source. You want someone to come to you in particular.
Apparently, you can pause a campaign for 15 days – but then when you call to cancel, they will tell you that you can actually pause for 90 days.
Scary and potentially bad for your company’s reputation. Also very interesting that these YouTube videos have a crazy amount of comments like this:
The number one reason that you should avoid Home Advisor is that it can ruin your website and your online presence. Because Home Advisor can afford to pay for more and Paid Ads, they can beat you down with money. Instead of working with Home Advisor for I’d encourage you to work with me, as then you will own the lead and the customers we produce. Home Advisor targets people that are looking for the cheapest option.
Only use Home Advisor in a desperate situation – and build your own website presence instead.
**“Get a lifelong and return customer and not someone looking for a one and done customer and looking for the lowest price… We stay away from HomeAdvisor, and I would advise you to do the same.”**
So yes, it may seem easier to go through a lead generation site like Home Advisor. However, if you genuinely want to take your marketing to new heights, investing in your own online presence through creating a website will help your business grow. Websites and other digital touchpoints (like social media) can help you establish your brand identity and will give your business a sense of transparency. A finely tuned site with smart SEO tactics that incorporates targeted, well-written content will benefit you far more than Home Advisor.
Check out our , our , , , , , , and .
If you are absolutely set on using a lead generation site, here are some higher quality options other than Home Advisor:
Houzz is probably one of the top lead generation sites for contractors and home builders. However, there are cons associated with it, such as Houzz owning everything on a contractor’s profile, including pictures, and expensive cancellation fees. Many contractors have built their entire business through Houzz, and it is certainly an option worth looking into.
Yelp receives a lot of traffic for people looking for services. But because this avenue is cluttered with the competition, including those who are willing to pay to be more visible. Yelp should be utilized but not as the primary form of lead generation. Instead, it should be used to help your website presence.
Home Advisor is an online marketplace that connects homeowners with licensed, pre-screened, approved service professionals who offer home renovation, , and maintenance services. They provide technologies that allow customers to connect quickly and easily to service professionals. They can utilize Instant Booking and schedule appointments without having to go back and forth between phone or email, trying to schedule a time that works for everyone. Instant Connect also speeds up the process, which is a service connecting customers with a Home Advisor specialist within minutes of their request. They also offer integration with smart devices such as the Amazon Echo and Apple Watch.
Home Advisor is totally free because of advertising fees paid to them from those service professionals that participate in the HomeAdvisor network. HomeAdvisor steps in to make the connections between the new customers and these service professionals, who pay a secondary fee for each lead they receive and connect with. Your free account on the website, My HomeAdvisor, is your personalized tool that keeps all your profile information secure, and it’s the place you can review service requests, professional matches, and manage all personal info.
HomeAdvisor’s details their 4 step process of screening their service professionals before matching them to the customer.
HomeAdvisor confirms that the service professional holds an applicable state-level trade licensing for the services they claim to be providing to consumers.
In the state in which the owner of the company is located, HomeAdvisor utilized third party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant or active criminal convictions associated with the service company. The extensiveness and comprehensiveness of the National Criminal Databases do vary from state to state, so HomeAdvisor considers this, and ensures this information discovered is accurate. This includes a registered sex offender search. HomeAdvisor checks websites that consolidate state sex offender information to confirm there is no match based on the name of the owner/principal of the company.
Again, HomeAdvisor uses third-party data sources to check for filings associated with bankruptcy, liens, civil legal judgments, etc. in the state in which the owner of the company is located. Only instances occurring within the 12 months prior to the service professional’s application for membership on HomeAdvisor are considered.
Lastly, HomeAdvisor confirms the social security numbers of the business owner, confirming their identity. This is mainly applicable to small businesses.
Have questions about HomeAdvisor? They have several ways you can get your questions answered. You can call them Toll-Free at 1-877-800-3177, where you can ask general questions or get connected with your local service provider. Not able to make a phone call? They have a live chat on their website M-F 6 am-5 pm and Sat-Sun 7 am-4 pm Mountain Standard Time. If you are not quite ready to contact them for services, they have a helpful section for popular Q & As.
Maybe HomeAdvisor/Angi Leads is just wielding Google better than you? Check out our , , , and Services to dominate Google. 
u003cstrongu003eHome Advisoru003c/strongu003e charges almost $300 per year for the basic service. Each of the leads sent to the contractors generates a variable u003cstrongu003efeeu003c/strongu003e, usually between $15 and $60+ per contractor and per lead.
Yes indeed. HomeAdvisor / IAC acquired Angie’s List in 2017 for 500 million.

HomeAdvisor is free for homeowners – because they charge contractors for the leads generated on the site. This process has frustrated some contractors, so HomeAdvisor pro has a lot of bad reviews, but homeowners don’t seem to feel the same way – from what is available of homeowner reviews online.
Home Advisor only checks for civil lawsuits and judgments dating back a year from when a contractor signs up to be a part of the service’s network. Once the background check has been done, that’s it – which may be concerning for homeowners. HomeAdvisor doesn’t repeat background checks on its contractors.
It seems to be a decent experience for homeowners. Many contractors complain that Home Advisor is bad for contractors. However, some contractors have sustained their business off of home advisor – and I have met 2 of these people, including a close friend of mine. u003cstrongu003eOn the whole, though – I have seen many, many more contractors frustrated with HomeAdvisor than not. u003c/strongu003e

Building your business through reviews and referrals is a great way to get more leads. Referral programs can be difficult to get started but when you do get a good one rolling it’s sure to pay off by getting you consistent business. Here are some :


It can be as simple as that. Just set up some goals, offer incentives, track your progress, and begin to see your past customers champion your business. You will want to be aware that the only way you can make a referral program really works well is by doing really good work for customers and always leaving them with a positive experience of your business.
The highly coveted 5-star review is something that eludes many business owners. From restaurants and bars to dental offices and it can be difficult to get reviews in the first place. But what’s worse is that the hardest part isn’t getting good reviews, it’s getting reviews at all. So how can you get more reviews for your business? You’ll have to make it easy for the customer. Here are some ways that you can encourage your customers to leave more reviews:
  * Offer incentives – things such as discounts or gift cards to local restaurants work great.
  * Ask – it’s common that many customers don’t even think to review. Just ask them for a review the next time you send an email.
  * Send a link to customers. Some customers might find it difficult to find where they should review your company. Make it easy for them by sending a link!
  * Be willing to receive reviews on multiple platforms including, Google, Facebook, and industry-specific platforms.


Establishing a Google My Business profile for your company is going to be essential in your success. From collecting reviews to properly displaying contact information and addresses, a Google business profile can be the difference between a customer purchasing from you or your competitor. Make sure that when you’re setting this up or editing it that every piece of information that can be filled out is. This ensures that when people are searching for your business or a similar one, they’ll find you.
Media-based advertising such as newspapers, mailers, television, and radio ads are also a great way to reach potential customers. If you’re able to specifically break down your target market and niche you can then very specifically target those potential customers. Radio, although seemingly underrated, has the potential to reach a multitude of customers. This post from is a great resource to learn more.

If your website isn’t bringing in leads or building trust, it’s time to rethink your strategy. Too many business websites are ego-driven, showcasing the company instead of solving problems for the customer. Let’s explore the and discover how to transform your site into a high-performing asset.
Most websites are built to satisfy the company’s ego, not to serve their audience. This self-obsession manifests as:


Websites should aim to reduce anxiety for potential customers, build trust, and convert visitors into paying customers.
Make it painfully obvious what you want visitors to do. Whether it’s “Call Now,” “Get a Free Quote,” or “Book a Consultation,” your CTA should:
  * Appear on every page—especially in the top-right corner and at the bottom.


: Include a call-to-action form on your homepage that doesn’t require a click to access. Make it for visitors to take the next step.
  * : Pair reviews with photos, 5-star ratings, and Google or Facebook logos for credibility.
  * : Showcase certifications, awards, or manufacturer partnerships as visual “seals of approval.”
  * : Make guarantees tangible with badge-like visuals (e.g., “100% Satisfaction Guaranteed”).


: Use real photos of your team or customers to humanize your business. A smiling customer builds far more trust than stock photography.
Make your customer the hero of the story. Use headlines and images that:
  * Use the “mirror effect”—smiling faces make visitors smile and feel good.
  * Highlight how you solve specific problems (e.g., “Get Comfort and Savings with Energy-Efficient HVAC”).


: Borrow storytelling techniques from Pixar! Identify your customer’s challenges and position your business as the guide that delivers transformation.
Your website is worthless if no one can find it. Prioritize:
  * : Create separate landing pages for each city or town you serve.
  * : Answer customer questions with helpful content (e.g., “How to Know When You Need Roof Replacement”).
  * : Link blog posts to key service pages to share authority.


: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify what potential customers are searching for and create content around those topics.
Stand out from the crowd with specific, customer-focused differentiators. Skip generic claims like “great customer service” and dig deeper:
  * What do customers rave about in your reviews? Highlight those traits.
  * Showcase unique services or benefits (e.g., “Same-Day Service,” “Lifetime Warranty,” or “Manufacturer-Certified Installers”).


: Create a “Why Choose Us” section above the fold with three compelling, specific differentiators.
If you’re spending money on ads to drive traffic but not converting visitors, you’re leaving money on the table. For example:
  * Increasing your conversion rate from 1% to 2% can on paid ads.
  * Trust factors and clear CTAs can reduce anxiety and boost conversions.


By focusing on the five key elements, you’ll turn your website into a lead-generating powerhouse.
Grab a pen, open your website, and check for the following:
  * : Is there a clear, standout call-to-action on every page?
  * : Do you have location pages, blog content, and internal links?
  * : Do your visuals and messaging focus on the customer’s needs?

  *   *   * 

Let’s be honest. Most home service websites miss the mark.
They focus too much on , not enough on .
Your website should be doing the heavy lifting, booking jobs, building credibility, and turning browsers into buyers.
  * 10 real examples of home service websites that actually convert


We’re breaking down exactly what makes these sites work, so you can take what’s proven, make it your own, and turn your website into a lead-generating machine.
Before we get into the websites that are doing it right, let’s talk about what’s going wrong.
If your site checks any of these boxes, it could be costing you leads:
It’s not about how long you’ve been in business or how many trucks you have. Customers want to know how you’re going to solve problem. If your copy is all about you, you’re missing the mark.
People need proof before they pick up the phone. Missing reviews, certifications, or even photos of your real team makes your business feel like a gamble.
A slow site, messy layout, or bad mobile experience turns visitors off fast. If people can’t find what they need in a few seconds, they’re already gone.
If you don’t have pages for the areas you serve, you’re invisible in local search results. That’s a huge missed opportunity for free traffic and qualified leads.
Great home service websites aren’t just pretty — they’re strategic. They guide people from curiosity to confidence to conversion. Here’s what the best ones consistently get right:
Your headline is usually the first thing people read — so make it count. Instead of saying “Welcome to XYZ Services,” say something like “Fast, Reliable in Denver.” Speak directly to the homeowner’s problem and how you solve it. This shift from company-centered to customer-centered messaging makes people feel seen and understood.
Design matters more than most people think. If your site looks outdated or cluttered, visitors may assume your service is too. Great sites use whitespace, bold visuals, and a clear layout to keep people engaged. A well-structured menu, prominent service pages, and an easy-to-find contact section help turn clicks into calls.
Trust is everything in . People are letting you into their homes — they need to feel confident in your team. Display 5-star reviews with real names and photos, highlight industry certifications (BBB, NATE, etc.), and include guarantees or warranties to back up your promises. Don’t hide your credibility — feature it proudly.
Every page should have a clear next step. Whether it’s a sticky “Call Now” button, a quote form, or a big “Schedule Service” section, your CTAs should be bold, consistent, and easy to find. Don’t make people dig for a way to contact you. Guide them toward action with buttons that stand out and copy that feels inviting.
If you want to get found online, you need pages that match what people are actually searching for. A “ Repair in Austin” page does more for your business than a generic “Services” tab ever will. These localized pages improve your Google rankings, bring in nearby customers, and show that you actually serve their area — which builds trust right out of the gate.
Let’s jump into the real-world examples — starting with one that checks all the boxes for clarity, trust, and strong branding.
The headline says it all: This speaks to the homeowner’s dream, not just the company’s offerings. Paired with subtext about free inspections, licensing, and family values, it immediately builds connection.


The red “Get Started Today” button is visible in two spots before you even scroll — once in the top-right menu, and again as part of a form with minimal friction (name, email, phone, zipcode, service).
Everything from the copy to the color scheme reflects a local, trustworthy brand that understands its Southern Minnesota audience. The messaging feels neighborly, not corporate, which goes a long way in .
Everything from the cozy family photo to the warm color palette is designed to make visitors the comfort that Smock delivers. It’s not just selling — it’s selling peace of mind.
Right under the hero section, Smock lays out three clear paths: sign up for savings, book your service, or get a water heater quote. This makes the site feel intuitive and reduces decision fatigue.
The mobile version is just as strong as desktop — with large, tappable buttons, readable , and a “Give Us a Call” CTA that’s always within reach.
The headline immediately anchors the company in “Frederick County,” reinforcing local credibility. Plus, key offerings like , , and are called out clearly — all without needing to scroll.
Right out of the gate, this site leads with purpose: The brand proudly positions itself as veteran-owned and community-focused, which creates a strong emotional and values-based connection with potential customers.
This site doesn’t just look polished — it showcases real service tech like drone inspections, reinforcing innovation and professionalism. The visuals communicate high-end service without needing to say it outright.
The main form sits prominently in the hero section and only asks for essential info — name, email, phone, city, and zip code — making it easy to take that first step without friction.
Important keywords like are placed strategically, while trust badges such as Google and Facebook ratings sit just below the fold, reinforcing credibility at a glance.
The homepage opens with a vibrant photo of a real, smiling family — perfectly matching the headline This instantly communicates warmth, trust, and a customer-focused mission.
Below the fold, Genz-Ryan features clear, clickable service offers (like a or ) that are hard to ignore. Each card is visually distinct and directly tied to a service line — a smart way to nudge conversions.
The playful but professional red and blue palette, rounded icons, and bold typography are used consistently across desktop and mobile. From the logo to CTA buttons, the branding reinforces reliability and friendliness at every touchpoint.
A 4.9-star Google rating sits front and center — immediately boosting credibility. The placement of “We’re Open 24/7!” and badges like “Lifetime Guarantee” add even more peace of mind for someone looking to schedule fast, reliable help.
hits both emotional and practical notes. It’s not just about roofs — it’s about helping homeowners feel secure and proud of where they live.
The quote form is impossible to miss, sitting front-and-center with a bright yellow “Get In Touch” button. With just three fields, it’s quick to fill out and drives immediate action.
Instead of stock photos, the homepage uses authentic imagery of a couple walking their dog outside their home. This adds warmth and relatability — and reinforces the idea that this company is truly local and community-minded.
Icons and short descriptions emphasize key differentiators like being , offering , and providing . These aren’t just buzzwords — they’re placed strategically to answer the biggest questions potential customers have right away.
Right away, visitors see the full team lined up in front of branded trucks. This kind of visual transparency builds instant trust — it shows you’re dealing with real people, not a faceless company.
is bold, punchy, and easy to remember. It conveys confidence and positions Bear’s Plumbing as the go-to solution for anything from leaks to major installs.
The playful bear mascot, red-and-black color palette, and slogan “We’re tough on leaks so you don’t have to be!” give the site a unique identity without losing professionalism. It’s serious about service, but still human and approachable.
The sticky highlight strip (family-owned, fast turnaround, reliable warranties) gives visitors key selling points at a glance, no scrolling required. It’s a subtle but powerful way to communicate value fast.
The aerial hero image gives visitors a top-down look at real project results — not stock photos. It subtly says, “We don’t just talk quality — we show it.” This level of professionalism adds major credibility in a high-trust industry.
positions Certified as more than just a service provider — they’re leaders in the space. It’s bold without being boastful and aligns well with a brand that’s tech-forward and high-end.
The design is spacious, modern, and intentional. Nothing feels cluttered, and the whitespace helps important CTAs and visuals stand out more clearly. This makes the user experience feel calm and confident.
Rather than burying the gallery, this site surfaces real work samples right under the main hero — making it easy for users to validate the company’s skill. Showing is always stronger than telling, and this site nails that.
This site feels premium right away. With a sleek black background, clean white text, and pops of red, it balances luxury with accessibility. It looks and feels like a modern home exterior — sharp, intentional, and beautifully constructed.
The headline frames the company as both craftsman and partner. This language makes the homeowner feel like they’re collaborating on something special — not just getting a job done.
With 15 years in the industry, glowing 4.9+ star ratings, and a “trusted by your neighbors” testimonial cue, this site quickly builds confidence without overselling. The messaging is humble but persuasive.
The “Let’s Get Started!” form is integrated cleanly into the design, with fields that are easy to complete and a button that stands out. On mobile, the tap-to-call feature is always visible, making it simple to take action on the go.
speaks directly to what homeowners actually care about — a safe, reliable, comfortable space for their families. And with callouts to the Twin Cities and surrounding communities, the local connection is crystal clear.
The circular photo frames and wave-inspired layout give this site a soft, approachable feel that’s still modern. It breaks away from the rigid grid you see on most service websites, helping it stand out immediately.
The embedded intro video with a personal touch gives visitors a chance to “meet” the team before they ever pick up the phone. It’s a fantastic way to humanize the brand and establish trust early.
The quote form is friendly, well-spaced, and uses conversational language like This lowers the intimidation factor and invites action with a welcoming tone.
immediately communicates that GreenTek isn’t just another roofing company — they offer cutting-edge, energy-efficient solutions. It’s short, confident, and memorable.
The messaging speaks to common frustrations like leaks, poor energy performance, and maintenance costs — then quickly pivots to how GreenTek solves them with “smart” options. This positions the company as both innovative and customer-focused.
From the sticky banner on mobile to the frictionless contact form on desktop, the site makes it incredibly easy for users to take action without commitment. That accessibility is a huge win for lead gen.
Badges for , , and give homeowners the assurance they need. Pair that with 5.0 Google and Facebook ratings, and you’ve got a trust-heavy first impression.
Templates are fast, cheap, and the demos always look clean and polished.
What looks great in a theme preview doesn’t always when it comes to real customers and real conversions.
  * They aren’t built with your unique customer journey in mind
  * You end up looking like everyone else in your market


Instead of starting with a generic design and trying to retrofit your business into it, flip the process.
Figure out what your ideal customer needs to hear, see, and feel, then design your site around 
They’re about being clear, trustworthy, and easy to take action on. A template won’t get you there, but a smart, strategy-first design will.
We get it, sometimes you just need to get something live. If you’re going the template route or using a site builder, here’s how to do it right.
Start with a builder that balances ease of use with SEO and speed. Some solid options:


You’re a service business, don’t use an eCommerce or portfolio theme. Look for:


Template demos use polished but generic text that looks nice — and says nothing. If your site still says it’s not helping you win business.
  * Replace fluff like “Our Mission” with value-driven sections like “Why Homeowners Choose Us” or “What to Expect.”
  * , not your company history. Instead of try _“No heat? We’ll fix it today — not next week.”_
  * Think: or 
  * How do customers describe your service? Use that wording in your headlines and CTAs.


Strong copy makes even a basic website work harder — and convert better.
Even with a basic layout, you can still stand out. Add:


Templates are fine for a starting point, just don’t treat them as a finish line. The real results come from good strategy, great content, and building trust with your audience
If you’re not ready for a full redesign, start here. These quick updates can make a big difference in how your site performs and how customers respond.
  1. **Use a smiling face with a finished project in your hero image** Showcase happy customers or real team members. It builds instant trust and gives your brand a human feel.
  2. Social proof should come early. Use real names, star ratings, and photos if possible.
  3. **Use “Get a Quote” forms with 6 or fewer fields** Long forms scare people off. Keep it short, simple, and focused on getting that first contact.
  4. **List certifications (like NATE, BBB, or GAF) in a clean, visible strip** Badges and affiliations build credibility. Make sure they’re easy to find.
  5. Lead with solutions. Instead of “About Our Company,” say “Need Fast HVAC Repair in [City]?”
  6. **Place phone number and CTA in the top-right menu bar** Your most important info should always be one click or tap away.
  7. Great for SEO and reassuring for customers. Make it clear where you work.
  8. **Use real photos — not stock — of your team and trucks** People want to see who they’re hiring. Real images go a long way in building trust.
  9. **Use bullets for your top value props near the top of each page** Make it easy for people to skim and get what you’re about right away.
  10. **Ask happy customers for the exact words they’d use to describe you** Use their language in your headlines, CTAs, and testimonials. It connects better.
  11. **Add FAQ dropdowns to reduce friction in the buying journey** Answer common objections without overwhelming the page with text.
  12. **Use high-contrast CTA buttons that stand out from your brand colors** Your calls-to-action should pop visually. Make them easy to spot and hard to miss.


These updates can be made in a day, but they’ll keep working for you around the clock.
Your home service website isn’t just a brochure — it’s your best salesperson.
It should build trust, answer questions, and guide people to take action — all without a phone call.
If your site is confusing, outdated, or focused more on your company than your customer, you’re leaving leads on the table.


Small improvements add up quickly — and the right changes can turn your site into a lead-generating machine that works 24/7.

  *   *   * 

When someone’s searching for help with a leaking roof, a busted furnace, or a clogged drain, they’re not scrolling for fun—they’re scanning for a solution, fast. That means where your business shows up on the search results page can make or break whether you get the call.
In the world of , there are where your company can appear on Google:
  * – The top-of-the-page section with the “Google Guaranteed” badge
  * – The map + 3-pack of local listings
  * – The traditional “blue link” listings underneath all of the above


Too often, business owners throw money at whatever marketing channel seems trendy—or whatever a salesperson just pitched them—without a clear strategy. 
But there a logic to how you should invest your time and budget.
Prioritize your marketing based on where each piece appears in the search results.
Why? Because users tend to click in the same order things show up on the page. It’s not about playing favorites—it’s about meeting your customers where they are, when they need you.
When it comes to visibility on Google, Local Services Ads (LSAs) are the absolute top of the page—and that’s exactly where your business needs to be.
These ads are specifically designed for local service providers and show up before everything else on the search results page. They feature the , which signals trust, professionalism, and accountability to homeowners in need of fast, reliable help. And instead of paying for every click (like traditional ), you only pay when someone actually reaches out through the ad.
Appear at the top of the search results, above PPC and organic listings
Pay-per-lead model means you only pay for real contact—not just traffic
Location and review-based prioritization means local businesses with great service stand out
At Hook, we specialize in crafting LSA campaigns for growth-minded home service businesses. We target actively looking for services like yours—think searches like “emergency plumber near me” or “roof repair in [city].”
  * We eliminate wasted spend and focus on the leads that convert


But the key isn’t just being listed—it’s . Hook’s in-depth keyword targeting, budget management, and monthly campaign refinements ensure that your business shows up 
  * You’re ready to capture high-converting traffic at the top of Google


Your ideal customer is already searching for your services—LSAs help you meet them at just the right moment.
Just beneath LSAs on the search results page sit traditional Google Search Ads, also known as ads. These listings may not have the “Google Guaranteed” badge, but they come with a different kind of power—.
With PPC, you’re not just bidding to appear—you’re deciding you appear. From the keywords you target, to the messaging in your ad copy, to the landing page users land on, every element can be dialed in to match your goals.
– Choose the exact search terms you want to show up for
– Craft ad copy that highlights promotions, values, or differentiators
– Send users to pages designed to convert
– Start small and increase spend as ROI becomes clear


We’ve found PPC works best when used 
> “Many home service companies waste thousands of dollars on clicks that go nowhere because the ad copy is vague, the landing page is weak, or the targeting is too broad.”
That’s why it’s crucial to build PPC campaigns that are focused on Testing headlines, refining keyword lists, and monitoring performance daily to make sure your budget is going toward actual revenue opportunities is how you’re going to get the highest return.
  * You’re ready to refine your messaging and land high-converting clicks


It’s not just about being seen—it’s about showing up .
Scrolling just a little further down past LSAs and PPC ads, you’ll find one of the most trusted sections of the search results page: the Google Maps 3-Pack, also known as the Local Pack.
This map-based listing showcases three local businesses near the searcher’s location, complete with star ratings, reviews, and contact info. For home service businesses, ranking here means you’re seen as a trusted option .
– You don’t pay to be listed, but you need to optimize to get there
Unlike LSAs and PPC, you can’t just pay to show up in the Local Pack. 


By optimizing your Google Business Profile and boosting efforts, you can show up more consistently in the Map Pack. From improving NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across the web to helping generate authentic 5-star reviews, small tweaks can create big gains in local visibility.
Focus here once your LSA and PPC campaigns are running smoothly. The Local Pack is a longer-term play, but it’s essential for:


If you want to be the business people think of in your area, Maps optimization isn’t optional—it’s .
Finally, beneath all the ads and map listings, you reach the —the classic blue links. And while it might take longer to climb to the top here, the payoff can be massive for home service businesses that stick with it.
– No ongoing ad spend required once you rank
– Become the trusted expert with service pages, blogs, and FAQs

  *   *   * 

Choosing a marketing agency can feel like a gamble. Everyone promises growth. Everyone says they “get results.” But when the dust settles, you’re often left with vague reports, minimal leads, and a team that barely understands your industry.
We’re not just another agency with a fancy deck. We’re a 30-person Google-specialized crew based in Minneapolis, all-in on getting real, qualified leads for and home service businesses.
  * , not just branding or busy work.
  * , and trusted by top coaches in the industry.
  * so you always know what we did and what it got you.


If you’re tired of paying for noise and want marketing that performs—let’s get into what makes our approach work.
A lot of agencies talk about “strategy.” We talk about results. Real, measurable, bottom-line outcomes.
At Hook, we’re laser-focused on lead generation because we know that’s what actually grows your business. Not branding fluff. Not buzzwords. Not vague consulting decks. Just high-intent leads, delivered consistently.
  * —because that’s where homeowners go 
  * Our content isn’t filler—it’s built to attract, engage, and convert real customers.
  * We touch every account weekly, optimizing budgets, adding negative keywords, and testing new angles to squeeze more out of every dollar.
  * Built from scratch on WordPress, custom-coded for speed, mobile-first, and designed to drive the next action (call, form fill, appointment).
  * We put full lead forms right on the main pages—no friction, no fluff.


We’ve worked with 75+ clients in , , and , and we’ve built this approach by obsessing over what actually works in this space.
Marketing is only valuable if it drives revenue. That’s why lead generation is our north star—every single tactic we use is judged by whether it gets the phone to ring.
Too many agencies build their business on dependency. They lock you into contracts, hold your website hostage, and make it painful to leave. That’s not partnership—that’s a trap.
When you work with us, —your website, your ad accounts, your analytics, and every login. If you ever decide to move on, we hand it all over, neatly documented. No drama. 
#### **_Easy Come, Easy Go – And That’s a Good Thing_**
Some people might think this is risky for us. But here’s the deal:
  * When clients know they can leave, they stay because they want to—not because they have to.
  * It keeps us sharp. Every month, we prove our value with results, not fine print.
  * And yes, we even —so the process is smooth if you ever leave.

  * Every person here lives and breathes roofing, HVAC, and plumbing.


We’re not the biggest agency in the game, but we’ve built a team that’s custom-fit for this niche. Writers who know what “ridge vent” means. pros who know what terms convert. Developers who build lightning-fast sites that drive action. No fluff roles, no generalists.
That means when you hire Hook, you’re not getting someone learning on the job. You’re getting:
  * A Google Ads manager who’s worked on 50+ accounts like yours
  * An SEO expert who knows how to rank in your city
  * A design + dev team that builds websites with performance and conversions in mind


That’s how we’ve been able to grow consistently, get results across 75+ clients, and earn trust from the biggest names in the industry.
It’s easy to say “we get results.” It’s harder to prove it. That’s why we don’t just we’re different—we back it up with hundreds of real testimonials, consistent referrals from industry coaches, and a portfolio that speaks for itself.
We’ve earned , and we didn’t get there by accident.
Clients don’t just like working with us—they see real growth, and they tell their friends. We’ve built this company on referrals, reputation, and showing up again and again for home service businesses that are serious about growth.

  * —because you shouldn’t have to wait a week for a website fix.


Clients mention us by name in reviews for a reason. Skylar, Dillon, Claudia, Sydnee, Vinny—their names come up because they’re doing the work, building real relationships, and helping businesses grow. That’s the standard here.
Get a demo of what it’s like to work with us and our services 
We know this industry. When you’ve got a fire to put out, or you’re ready to hit the gas, you need a team that .
We don’t disappear after the sale. We stay in the trenches with you, month after month, making sure your digital presence is sharp, fast, and performing. If something’s not working, we fix it. If you need something new, we’re already thinking about it.
Because great marketing isn’t just about tactics. It’s about showing up, doing the work, and giving a damn.
If your marketing isn’t delivering consistent, qualified leads—or you’re just tired of wondering what your agency is actually doing—it might be time for a change.
We work with roofing and home service companies that are serious about scaling and want a team that knows the industry, moves fast, and delivers.
**What sets us apart is focus, execution, and transparency. We specialize in your industry, we have a full in-house team, and we keep you informed with clear reporting and consistent results.**

  *   *   * 

Whether you’re looking to sell your company, buy one, or simply get a clearer picture of what it’s worth, understanding how to properly value a heating and air business is essential.
businesses continue to be some of the most attractive opportunities on the market — thanks to consistent cash flow, essential services, and strong, steady demand. When you have a clear sense of value, you can make better decisions, avoid costly mistakes, and move forward with confidence.
Maintenance contracts and service agreements create reliable, predictable income year-round.
Heating and cooling aren’t optional — they’re necessary. That keeps demand steady even when the economy slows down.
Many HVAC businesses are built on lasting relationships and word-of-mouth, creating a strong competitive advantage in their markets.
  * Common valuation methods — and when each one makes sense
  * Practical tips to help you increase your company’s value before you sell


Valuing an HVAC company isn’t the same as valuing just any business — and that’s a good thing. HVAC businesses operate with a few unique strengths (and challenges) that directly impact what they’re worth.
One of the biggest value drivers in an HVAC business is its maintenance agreements. Regular service contracts generate consistent cash flow and create a built-in customer base for future repairs and replacements. 
Buyers and investors love predictability — and a strong portfolio of service agreements can make a big difference in how your company is valued.
Unlike e-commerce brands or national chains, HVAC businesses grow through relationships. Word-of-mouth, repeat customers, and a strong local presence all play a major role. 
A company’s reputation in the community isn’t just a nice-to-have — **it’s a core asset that can set it apart in the eyes of a buyer.**
Demand for heating and cooling naturally rises and falls with the seasons. A business’s ability to manage cash flow during slower months — or offer services that balance the ups and downs (like , electrical, or indoor air quality solutions) — can impact overall value. And when it comes to growth potential, few things are as important as a strong, stable team. Skilled labor shortages can limit expansion, while a well-trained crew makes a business much more attractive.
> “Recurring service agreements can make up 30%–50% of a successful HVAC company’s total revenue, providing a stable, year-round income stream.”— 
In short, an HVAC company’s value isn’t just about top-line revenue — it’s about the and of that revenue, the reputation it’s built, and the strength of the team behind it.
Not every HVAC business is valued the same way — and for good reason. Buyers and investors look at a range of factors that can either boost or pull down a company’s worth. Here’s what really moves the needle:
  * Strong revenue is important, but profitability is what really counts. Buyers look for steady growth paired with healthy margins — not just how much you make, but how efficiently you make it.
  * EBITDA strips out financing and tax variables to show true operational profitability. A strong EBITDA almost always leads to a higher valuation multiple.
  * A loyal, diversified customer base is a major advantage. Long-term relationships and low turnover add stability and reduce risk.
  * Maintenance contracts create consistent, predictable revenue and help smooth out seasonal dips. The more service agreements — and the stronger they are — the more attractive your business becomes.


  * Five-star reviews, a professional website, strong SEO, and an active social media presence lift perceived value and make growth easier for a buyer.
  * Skilled, stable technicians are key assets. High turnover is a warning sign, while certifications, experience, and loyalty increase a company’s appeal.
  * Businesses that run efficiently without daily owner involvement — using tools like ServiceTitan, CRMs, automated billing, and documented processes — are much easier to transition and grow.
  * Growing markets with strong economies typically boost valuations. High competition can drag it down unless you have clear advantages.
  * Trends like housing growth, consumer confidence, and energy incentives impact HVAC demand. Strong businesses with solid fundamentals stand out in any market.


> HVAC businesses with consistent 10–15% net profit margins and a diversified customer base tend to command the highest valuations.
Once you know the key factors that influence value, the next step is figuring out how to calculate it. Several methods are commonly used to value HVAC businesses, depending on the size and stability of the company.
  *     * Represents the total financial benefit a single owner-operator derives from the business, including profits, salary, and discretionary expenses.
    * Typical SDE multiples range from , depending on growth, service agreements, and reputation.
  *     * Used more often for larger HVAC companies with management layers beyond the owner.
    * EBITDA multiples typically range from , or higher for top-performing companies.


  *     * Quick and simple, but less precise because it doesn’t account for profitability.
    * HVAC businesses might sell for of annual revenue, but buyers still expect healthy margins underneath.
  *     * Focuses on the market value of physical assets like trucks, equipment, tools, and inventory.
    * Typically used when the business isn’t very profitable or is shutting down.
    * Establishes a “floor” value based on hard assets rather than cash flow.


> Businesses with over in service agreement revenue often command higher valuation multiples because of the predictability and recurring nature of income.— 
Each method has its place. A well-established, profitable HVAC business with strong recurring revenue is likely to earn a higher multiple — whether using SDE, EBITDA, or even a revenue-based approach.
Even if you’re not planning to sell right away, getting your business “sale-ready” can boost profitability and make your company much more attractive to future buyers. A few strategic moves now can have a major impact on your final valuation.
  * Accurate, organized financials are non-negotiable. Buyers want to see clear revenue, expense, and profit numbers. Solid bookkeeping, tax planning, and financial reporting now will save you major headaches later.
  * Businesses that run smoothly without heavy owner involvement are worth more. Document everything — scheduling, service protocols, lead follow-up, inventory management — to make your company more transferable and scalable.
  * Service agreements create recurring revenue and customer loyalty — both highly attractive to buyers. Focus on increasing the number of active, renewable maintenance contracts.


  * A highly skilled, stable team is a major asset. Offer certifications, training programs, and competitive benefits to keep top talent onboard. Buyers look closely at technician turnover rates.
  * Boost your Google reviews, modernize your website, create strong SEO content, and stay active on social media. A strong digital footprint builds buyer confidence and reduces perceived risk.
  * Business brokers, accountants, and valuation experts can help you prepare your company for sale and highlight its strengths. A small upfront investment often leads to a much higher selling price.


> Businesses that invest in recurring revenue, reduce owner dependency, and build strong online brands often command up to .
Getting your HVAC business ready for sale isn’t just about cleaning house — it’s about building something that’s attractive, profitable, and easy to grow. Even if selling is years away, these steps add real value today.
If you’re curious about what your HVAC business might be worth but aren’t ready to invest in a full appraisal, an online valuation calculator can be a great starting point. Tools like the offer a quick way to estimate your company’s value based on basic financial and operational information.
  * Be prepared to enter: 
  * The tool uses your inputs and applies industry-standard multiples based on business size, profitability, recurring revenue, and market conditions.Some calculators also factor in qualitative elements like online reviews, brand strength, and owner dependency.
  * Online calculators are great for getting a ballpark figure, but they can’t replace a detailed professional valuation.Real-world buyers look deeper into customer loyalty, team stability, operational systems, and competition — factors a simple calculator might overlook.


> An online calculator is a smart first step — but if you’re serious about selling or buying an HVAC business, it should never be your last.
Think of a valuation calculator like a quick checkup. If you like the number you see — or if it sparks new questions — you’re already moving in the right direction toward smarter decisions about your company’s future.
While an online calculator is a helpful starting point, there are times when you’ll want a full, professional valuation to truly understand your HVAC business’s worth. Especially when large sums of money—and your future—are at stake, expert guidance can make all the difference.
  * If you’re planning to sell within the next 1–3 years, a professional valuation gives you a clear, defensible number to present to buyers. It also helps you spot areas for improvement that can boost your final sale price.
  * When merging, acquiring another company, or buying out a partner, a formal valuation ensures everyone is on the same page — helping avoid costly disputes.
  * If your business is part of your retirement or estate plan, knowing its value is essential. A professional appraisal provides a solid foundation for smart financial planning.
  * Investors and lenders want proof of value before committing money. A formal valuation shows your business is credible, valuable, and worth backing.


> Businesses with formal valuations sell and for on average, according to .
In short: if you’re making a major move that hinges on your HVAC business’s value, don’t leave it to guesswork. Hiring a business appraiser or broker can give you peace of mind — and help you unlock the full value you’ve worked hard to build.
Valuing a heating and air conditioning business is both an art and a science. It’s not just about how much revenue you generate — it’s about the stability, efficiency, and future potential of your company.
From recurring service agreements and loyal customers to skilled technicians and a strong brand presence, many factors drive value. Understanding these elements helps you make smarter decisions — whether you’re planning to sell, buy, or simply strengthen your business for the future.
  * Focus on creating steady, predictable income streams and systems that don’t rely on you being involved in every decision.
  * Well-documented financials and smooth day-to-day operations are major value drivers.
  * Skilled technicians, a positive reputation, and a strong digital footprint all boost perceived and actual value.
  * **Use Online Calculators for Estimates — but Rely on Professional Valuations for Big Decisions:** Ballpark figures are helpful early on, but expert guidance is critical when real money is on the line.


Whether you’re just beginning to think about your HVAC business’s worth or you’re ready to take the next big step, understanding valuation gives you a major advantage.
And remember: **the best time to start building value is right now.**

  *   *   * 

Hiring a great tech, or becoming one, starts with the interview. 
It’s where first impressions are made, red flags show up, and potential gets revealed.
And in an industry where skilled workers are in , a solid interview process isn’t just a formality, it’s a big part of long-term success. 
The right hire can bring in revenue, build customer trust, and boost morale. 
It’s not about trick questions or grilling people. It’s about having the right conversations. You want to understand how someone works, how they solve problems, and how they show up on the job.
  * who want to build a solid, reliable team
  * who are prepping to land a great job—and want to stand out for the right reasons


Whether you’re asking the questions or answering them, these prompts are designed to dig deeper than just “Do you have experience?” They’ll help you uncover work ethic, mindset, and technical skills in a way that feels real, not rehearsed.
Before jumping into the hands-on knowledge, start with the human side. These questions give insight into:
  * How they might in the field and with customers


It’s not just about what they know—it’s about how they show up.
Here’s a breakdown of what to ask — and what to listen for:
This open-ended question helps set the tone. Let them walk you through their background, certifications, and the types of systems they’ve worked on. You’ll get a sense of how comfortable they are talking about their skills and whether they’ve had steady, relevant experience.
clear timelines, specific examples, and pride in their work. Bonus points if they speak confidently but without ego.
**2. How do you stay updated on HVAC technology or codes?**
The industry is constantly evolving. This question reveals whether they take initiative to keep learning. Are they reading trade publications? Watching YouTube channels? Attending training sessions?
curiosity, motivation to improve, and familiarity with tools or trends like smart thermostats or mini-splits. A tech who’s committed to growth is always more valuable.
**3. What’s your approach when dealing with a difficult customer?**
You’re not just hiring technical skills — you’re hiring someone who might be the only person your client interacts with. This question uncovers emotional intelligence and professionalism under pressure.
a calm, respectful approach. Do they prioritize understanding the customer’s concerns? Do they try to educate rather than argue? That matters more than solving the issue fast.
**4. Describe a time you made a mistake. What did you learn?**
Mistakes happen. This one tests their honesty, accountability, and ability to grow. A red flag would be someone who blames others or avoids giving a real answer.
a clear story, reflection on what went wrong, and what they’ve done differently since. Owning a mistake shows maturity.
You want to know what lights them up. This question gives insight into whether they’re passionate about the trade or just clocking in.
genuine enthusiasm — maybe it’s solving tricky problems, working with their hands, or making customers happy. Passion fuels performance.
> These questions help gauge attitude and long-term potential. You’re not just filling a position — you’re investing in a teammate. Look for people who are honest, humble, and eager to grow.
Next up: let’s get into the technical side of the interview.
Once you’ve covered the basics, it’s time to get into the technical side of things. These questions help you understand a candidate’s knowledge of HVAC systems, tools, diagnostics, and how they handle real-world service calls.


These aren’t meant to trip someone up — they’re meant to reveal how they think.
**1. How do you determine the right size HVAC system for a home?**
This shows whether they understand load calculations and efficiency. A qualified tech should mention Manual J calculations, square footage, insulation factors, and not just “rule of thumb” estimates.
thoughtful explanations based on real metrics, not just gut feelings or guesses. This question can separate seasoned pros from shortcut takers.
**2. Walk me through your diagnostic process when a unit isn’t cooling.**
You’re looking for a clear, logical approach. This question reveals how they troubleshoot and whether they’re methodical or scattered under pressure.
step-by-step problem-solving. Do they start with airflow? Thermostat settings? Electrical components? Their process should show they don’t jump to conclusions.
These systems are becoming more common, especially in energy-conscious regions. A strong tech should have familiarity with installation and repair for both.
comfort with both traditional and newer equipment, along with any manufacturer-specific experience. If they’ve only worked on older systems, that’s worth noting.
**4. How comfortable are you with reading schematics and blueprints?**
This reveals their technical literacy. Even if they’re not in design or estimating, being able to follow a wiring diagram or building plan is a big plus.
confidence and examples. They don’t have to be an expert drafter, but they should at least be comfortable navigating technical drawings on a job site.
This gives insight into their precision and use of proper tools. A qualified answer might include dye testing, electronic leak detectors, or nitrogen pressure tests.
accuracy, safety awareness, and a respect for EPA guidelines. Bonus points if they emphasize documentation and customer communication.
> Strong techs can explain technical work in a way that’s easy to follow. Pay attention not just to what they know, but how clearly they explain it — because that’s how they’ll talk to your customers too.
Next: let’s talk safety and compliance. It matters more than ever.
Technical skill is important, but so is knowing how to work safely and responsibly. In HVAC, one careless move can cause serious damage — to people, property, or the environment. These questions help you understand how seriously a candidate takes safety protocols and industry regulations.


**1. What safety procedures do you follow when working with refrigerants?**
Refrigerants can be dangerous, and proper handling is non-negotiable. This question gives insight into how closely they follow EPA guidelines and whether they’ve been properly trained.
mention of recovery machines, PPE, avoiding venting, and keeping logs. Their answer should show awareness of both safety and environmental impact.
**2. How do you ensure you’re up to date with EPA regulations?**
This one tells you how proactive they are about staying current. Rules can change, especially around refrigerants and disposal.
responses that include ongoing training, certification renewals, or learning from manufacturer updates. If they say “the boss handles that,” it’s a red flag.
Lockout/tagout (LOTO) is critical for avoiding electrical and mechanical accidents. This question helps you gauge how seriously they take routine safety steps.
step-by-step procedures, not just “yeah, I do it.” Bonus if they mention double-checking for residual energy or securing the system before starting work.
**4. Have you ever reported a safety concern to management?**
This question can reveal integrity and communication. Someone who brings up issues rather than hiding them is someone you want on your team.
real-life examples and a clear understanding of when and why they spoke up. Even a small incident can show the right mindset.
> Safety habits are usually formed long before the interview. Look for techs who take pride in doing things right — not just fast. They’ll protect your customers, your team, and your reputation.
Next up: soft skills and customer service. Because technical ability isn’t the whole picture.
HVAC isn’t just about tools and diagnostics. It’s also about trust. Technicians are often the face of your company, stepping into someone’s home and explaining complex systems to people who may not know a condenser from a capacitor.
Soft skills make all the difference. These questions help you uncover how a candidate interacts with customers, manages conflict, and communicates clearly.


This question is all about clarity and approach. A great tech should be able to break down technical problems in simple, respectful language that builds confidence.
real-world examples of explaining issues without jargon. Bonus if they talk about using analogies or visual aids to help customers understand what’s going on.
**2. What would you do if a client refused your repair recommendation?**
This reveals how they handle rejection and discomfort. The best techs won’t get defensive or pushy — they’ll stay calm, explain the risks, and leave the door open.
empathy, patience, and a focus on helping the customer make an informed choice. If they bring up documenting the refusal for liability reasons, even better.
**3. Have you ever turned an upset customer into a loyal one?**
Here’s your chance to hear about emotional intelligence in action. This question shows how they respond when things go wrong — which they will, at some point.
a clear story, an understanding of what went wrong, and how they took ownership or went the extra mile. Look for someone who values long-term relationships over being “right.”
> Be ready with real stories. Your ability to connect with people, stay calm under pressure, and build trust is what separates good techs from great ones.
Even if someone checks every technical box, they still might not be the right fit. Long-term success comes down to how well a tech fits into your team and how committed they are to growing.
These questions help you understand who they are beyond the resume — their values, attitude, and potential for leadership or development within your company.
  * If they’re open to 
  * Whether they have a or are just looking for a paycheck


**1. What does a “great HVAC team” look like to you?**
This is a great window into their expectations and team mentality. Their answer will reflect what they value — communication, accountability, support — or where they’ve had issues in the past.
signs that they want to contribute, not just show up. Bonus points if they highlight respect, mentorship, or shared goals.
A classic question for a reason. It helps you understand whether they’re thinking ahead — and whether your company can help them get there.
ambition paired with realism. Maybe they want to become a lead tech, train others, or get certified in new areas. Avoid vague or overly passive answers like “I don’t really know.”
**3. Are you open to learning other trades or cross-training?**
This can show you how flexible they are and how much value they could bring over time. Cross-trained employees are incredibly useful for growing businesses.
curiosity, past examples of picking up new skills, or excitement about becoming more well-rounded. Avoid rigid “I just do HVAC” mindsets unless that’s all you’re hiring for.
**4. Do you prefer working independently or as part of a crew?**
There’s no wrong answer here — but it should match what the job requires. This question helps you avoid placing someone in the wrong environment.
honest preferences and examples. If they say “both,” ask for context — do they thrive in solo service calls or collaborate well on installs?
> Culture fit isn’t about hiring people who are all the same. It’s about finding those who align with your mission, respect the team, and want to grow with you.
Next, we’ll go over a few red flags and subtle warning signs to watch for during the interview process.
Not every candidate who seems solid at first glance is the right long-term hire. Pay close attention to what’s said between the lines — because red flags tend to show up early if you know where to look.
Here are some of the most common signs that a tech might not be the right fit:
If a candidate struggles to explain their past roles, jumps around in their story, or leaves out key details, it could point to performance or accountability issues.
Confusing timelines, job gaps with no explanation, or stories that change when you ask follow-ups.
Listen closely when they talk about past challenges. Are they always the victim? Do they throw past coworkers or customers under the bus?
Frequent blaming, zero ownership, or language that shifts responsibility onto others.
HVAC is a trade that evolves constantly. A good tech should be open to training, feedback, and improving their skills. A know-it-all mindset is usually a dead end.
Dismissive comments about new tools or methods, reluctance toward certifications, or “I already know how to do all that” energy.
It’s one thing to have a bad experience. It’s another to carry resentment. Techs who vent too much about former bosses or bash customers may not handle pressure well.
Complaints about “idiot customers,” long rants about previous employers, or sarcasm when discussing client interactions.
> One or two awkward moments? Totally normal. But if you notice a of defensiveness, negativity, or inflexibility — that’s your cue to dig deeper or move on.
Let’s wrap this up with something for the candidates: smart questions they should be asking you.
A great interview goes both ways. While employers are evaluating candidates, smart techs are also trying to figure out if company is the right fit for their future.
Encourage candidates to ask questions — and pay attention to the ones who do. It often shows initiative, professionalism, and long-term thinking.
####  What does a typical day on the job look like?
This helps them understand the pace, workflow, and variety of jobs they’ll encounter. It also gives you a chance to set realistic expectations.
Do they describe a structured system, or does it sound like chaos every day?
####  What kind of training or advancement opportunities do you offer?
Candidates who ask this are thinking ahead — which is a good thing. It shows they want to grow, not just stay in a comfort zone.
Be clear about mentorships, certifications, or the potential to move into lead tech or management roles.
This question gets into work-life balance and expectations after hours. No one likes surprises here.
A system that rotates fairly, clear communication, and some flexibility. Candidates want to know you respect their time.
It’s a practical but important question. Candidates want to know what resources they’ll have, what they’re expected to bring, and whether the company invests in its people.
Whether it’s fully stocked vans or BYO tools, the key is transparency.
> Candidates who ask thoughtful questions aren’t being picky — they’re showing that they care about where they work. Those are often your most reliable hires.
A strong interview isn’t just a formality. It’s your chance to build a better team, or land a job that truly fits.
take the time to ask thoughtful questions, document the answers, and look for patterns. The right hire is someone who not only has the skills but also aligns with your company’s values and work style.
come prepared with real stories, show your curiosity, and stay authentic. You don’t need to be perfect — you just need to be honest and coachable.

I really love Standard’s brand – it feels high-end, and certainly bringing their people to the forefront emphasizes their size and capabilities.
I believe the call-to-action could be clearer (what’s my next step as a visitor.) Also – I think pictures and testimonials of happy customers are really important to keep prominent right when a visitor lands on the website._Perhaps we’re partial to Standard because their office is 2 blocks away from ours_
Super simple design, with the phone number quick, the way to email, and the live chat. Surprisingly, not very many HVAC companies I looked at were using live chat as of 2020. Seems like an opportunity, especially if you have customer service people at the ready for phone calls at the office anyways.
Reviews, badges, and testimonials should be prominent and above the fold. The contact link on the navigation bar should be called out, and ideally, there would be at least one smiling face of a happy customer right when you land on the page.
I absolutely love the smiling couple up front on the site, presumably clients. The bullet points with key differentiating features is brilliant and so is the big phone number in the header – I’m sure this helps the flow of leads into their site on a regular basis.
Once again – I’d pair the happy couple with a little testimonial from a client. Other than that, this is a stellar example of an “above the fold” design – meaning if someone didn’t scroll they could get a lot of the key information and be able to move forward with this HVAC company if they wanted to.
I don’t really suggest them – but there are 3 options for ‘website builders’ that will work for a construction company.
We love WordPress for real, and substantial reasons- but you can definitely get started with a Wix website or Squarespace, start blogging, and get links back to your website (huge for Google visibility.)
  * –for photography heavy websites with simple sleek design (not great for SEO.) 
  * – A ton of different templates, but with more options, often ends up looking unprofessional. 


We believe getting trust is the most important part of making an effective HVAC company website.
  1. So our first suggestion is to have a ‘review carousel’ with images of the people who left the reviews, a 5-star icon, and where the review was left (a third-party logo gives the review credibility.)
  2. Have a ‘Get a quote’ form at the top of every selling page, and a button on the top right of each pages menu nudging people in the direction of the primary purpose of the website.
  3. Include real pictures of your team, your office, and your happy customers – as much as you possibly can.
  4. Prominently display your phone number next to the call to action button in the menu, and ensure your address is on the bottom of each page.
  5. Make sure you have 500+ words on every page of your website, and break up your text with images, so people aren’t confronted with a ‘wall of text.’



Clearly – it’s not just about visually stunning design when it comes to an HVAC websites design, it’s also about creating clear hierarchy, getting trust – and making everything super easy to get to.
If your website doesn’t have all of these things – and doesn’t visually represent your company in the most professional light, it may be time for a redesign.
**People trust Hook Agency to create a high-end visually persuasive website because:**
  * We know how to make an easy-to-edit website on industry-standard WordPress.
  * We have designers who develop as well, and do completely custom website’s so you don’t end up with a weird looking website like some companies who build on slow & clunky themes.


if we can help you’d like our help creating a stunning HVAC website design for your company!
A ‘WordPress theme’ is a way to roll out a structure / look on a WordPress site very quickly. There is a lot of work to rolling out HVAC WordPress templates and themes – so use a little caution when you see the demonstrations, as they are hard to match. Always deploy ‘sample content’ whenever you use a WordPress theme as soon as possible after purchasing and before adding any content yourself.
What makes them successful is PROMOTION. Whether you do aggressive , Facebook ads, or Google – the promotion is what really gets the leads. The website design needs to be 80% to ideal, and then aggressive promotion is absolutely essential. Whether you’re at 80% (and your website gets trust, and calls customers to action) and you need to promote more aggressively is the real question. Is your promotion aggressive enough?
There are several options for HVAC website companies besides us (though we’d love to be of service.) Other respected HVAC website design companies include Blue Corona, and Deluxe.
To have an effective marketing strategy for your HVAC company – you need to be where people are searching, build your brand, and be social. How to be there when people are searching? Create regular content for questions people ask in the sales process, answer questions, and earn links from other websites around the web. Identify your top 50 keywords and use tight keyword targeting in Google ads, build your brand by sponsoring local teams, taking out a billboard, and taking local events by storm. Be social by creating a rhythm on 2-3 key social media platforms sharing the stories of your customers, reviews, how-to videos and sharing your blog content (answering top customer questions.)
Yes indeed – we can help you get in front of more customers.

  *   *   * 

Not every company is ready to dive into , Google Ads, and a full website revamp. That’s totally fine. We’re big believers in meeting businesses where they’re at.
But when you’re ready to grow—and you want a marketing partner who actually cares? That’s where we show up strong.
The ideal Hook Agency client isn’t perfect, but they’re moving. They’ve got momentum. They’re not guessing anymore, they’re building with purpose.
**These are the kinds of companies that thrive with us:**
  * Led by owners who care deeply about growth and consistency
  * Running multiple lead generation strategies and ready to amplify what’s working


If that sounds like you, we might be a great fit. Let’s take a closer look at what makes for a strong partnership and what sets our most successful clients apart.
We have so much respect for new businesses hustling to get off the ground. In fact, many of our favorite long-term clients started there. But when it comes to full-scale and Google Ads campaigns, timing is everything.
Early-stage businesses often aren’t quite ready for the investment that’s required to get real results from digital marketing. These strategies take:
  * A solid internal process that turns traffic into booked jobs


Rather than rushing into paid services too soon, we recommend diving into the we’ve built specifically for businesses in the early stages:
  * Dozens of on everything from Google Maps rankings to lead generation tips


We’re rooting for you—and we’re here when the timing’s right.
While we’re happy to support a range of businesses, the majority of our best-performing clients fall in the $3–15 million revenue range. At this stage, marketing isn’t just a nice-to-have; it becomes a powerful lever for growth, brand authority, and long-term lead generation.
  * Looking for a way to scale efficiently without sacrificing quality


They’re not just trying to stay afloat—they’re building something sustainable. And they’re looking for a marketing partner who can help them make smart, measurable moves.
Take , for example. When they partnered with us, they already had strong internal operations, clear sales goals, and a hunger to grow their local dominance. With systems in place to handle more leads, they weren’t just hoping marketing would work—they were to make it work.
For companies in this sweet spot, we bring in the firepower:
  * High-converting websites that tell the brand story and drive action


If you’re in this range—and your team is aligned around growth—Hook might be exactly what you need to level up.
Being in “growth mode” isn’t just about hitting a certain revenue mark, it’s a mindset. It’s the difference between hoping leads show up and building a system that generates them consistently.
Our ideal clients aren’t waiting around for referrals. They’re proactive, strategic, and constantly improving.
  * Treat marketing as a long-term investment, not a quick fix
  * Have multiple lead generation systems in play (think SEO, Google Ads, LSA, door knocking, referrals, direct mail, etc.)
  * Take internal responsibility for speed-to-lead, lead tracking, and sales conversion


A great example is . They don’t just “check the marketing box”—they live it. They’re out in their community, sponsoring local events, dialing in their brand presence, and staying agile with new tactics. Their team treats attention like currency, and they invest in it accordingly.
That kind of energy amplifies everything we do on the backend—making our SEO and efforts even more effective. When you’re in growth mode and your team is locked in, marketing becomes a multiplier.
What separates a good client from a great one? It’s not just about budget or market size, it’s about how they approach the partnership.
The best clients treat us like a strategic partner, not just another vendor. They bring just as much energy to the table as we do. That’s when the magic happens.
Here’s what we consistently see in our most successful partnerships:


is a perfect example. From day one, their sales team was dialed in. That meant every lead we helped generate through SEO and Google Ads had a much higher chance of turning into real revenue. Their internal clarity made our external efforts exponentially more effective.
Great marketing only works when the backend is tight. When leadership is involved, the team is aligned, and the systems are solid—results come faster and last longer.
While $3–15M is our sweet spot, we also work with several companies well beyond that range—some doing $50 million or more in annual revenue.
These organizations often already have an internal marketing team. But they bring us in when they want to:


The best large companies don’t let bureaucracy slow them down. They stay nimble, they collaborate closely, and they focus on results. They value clear reporting, strategic input, and accountability across the board.
If a company is serious about staying sharp—and wants a partner who can deliver at a high level—we’re all in.
We talk a lot about our “ideal client,” but the truth is—plenty of companies are just one or two moves away from being in that zone. 
You don’t have to have it all figured out. You just need to be building with intention.
  * Your website gets traffic, but it’s not converting the way you hoped
  * You’re investing time or money into marketing but not seeing the ROI
  * You’ve built strong operational systems and are ready to scale
  * You feel like you’ve outgrown DIY marketing and need deeper support


At this stage, many business owners feel stuck between what’s worked in the past and what it’s going to take to reach the next level. That’s a good sign. It means you’re paying attention, and it means you’re close.
We’ve worked with companies who came to us right at that tipping point. 
They had momentum, but things weren’t firing on all cylinders. 
Once we helped them tighten up their website, launch targeted SEO campaigns, and dial in their Google Ads strategy, growth became a lot more predictable—and a lot less stressful.
> **If this sounds familiar, you don’t need to wait until everything’s perfect.**
You just need to be ready to collaborate, to move with purpose, and to treat marketing like the strategic tool it is.
And when you’re there, we’d love to be the team that helps you step on the gas.
At Hook Agency, we don’t take a one-size-fits-all approach, and we’re not trying to work with everyone.
We do our best work with home service businesses that are dialed-in, driven, and ready to scale. 
Companies that treat marketing as a strategic investment, not just another line item.
If your team is in sync, your systems are strong, and you’re hungry for the next level, we’re built for you.
**Because the best companies deserve a marketing partner that’s just as committed to growth as they are.**

## Page: https://hookagency.com/blog/job-site-branding

  *   *   * 

Most think about , Google Ads, or websites when they hear “marketing.”
But one of your most powerful marketing tools is right in front of you: .
Your job site isn’t just where you work — it’s where you advertise.
A clean, organized, and professionally branded project sends a loud message to homeowners, neighbors, and anyone driving by: .
In industries like and construction, customers usually can’t inspect the finished product themselves. That’s why the things they see — your signs, trucks, gear, and overall site appearance — matter even more.
Done right, job site branding builds trust before you ever say a word.
When it comes to construction and , most homeowners don’t judge your work by the technical details — because they can’t. Very few people are climbing onto their roof to inspect chimney flashings or measure shingle alignment. Instead, they judge your company based on what they see from the ground.
That’s where strong job site branding makes all the difference. 
  * People make snap decisions based on appearances. A clean, organized, and branded job site instantly communicates professionalism, even before the project is finished. A messy site, on the other hand, can leave doubts about the quality of your work — even if the craftsmanship is excellent.
  * Branded yard signs, wrapped vehicles, company shirts, and neat workspaces show you care about every detail. When you show pride in your appearance, customers believe you’ll show pride in their project too.
  * Especially in close residential neighborhoods, your job site gets seen by dozens — sometimes hundreds — of people a day. Every neighbor walking their dog or driving by is a potential future customer. A well-presented job site makes a strong impression without spending a dollar on extra advertising.
  * When one neighbor sees your professional site, they’re more likely to recommend you. If they ask the homeowner who did their roof, your clean branding and visible presence will already be top of mind.


In short, job site branding isn’t just about looking good. It’s a powerful, free marketing tool that shows people you take your work — and their trust — seriously.
Strong job site branding isn’t complicated — it’s about being intentional with how you show up. Here are the five key areas to focus on:
During construction, it’s almost impossible to avoid making a mess. Tear-offs get messy, debris falls, and landscaping can easily get damaged if you’re not careful. That’s where products like come in.
The Catch-All systems are breathable covers designed to protect landscaping and exterior areas during a roofing project. Unlike traditional tarps, they allow airflow, which helps prevent plants from getting scorched in the sun.
Beyond protection, they also offer a great opportunity to reinforce your brand. Some companies customize their Catch-Alls with logos, making the job site look even more professional while keeping everything neat.
It’s a simple way to show customers you’re thinking ahead — and that **you care about their property as much as they do.**
Yard signs are one of the easiest and most effective branding tools. Every project you complete should have at least one yard sign proudly displayed.
Here are a few tips to get the most out of them:
  * to place signs, and if the homeowner is open to it, consider placing more than one — especially if the property is on a corner lot or sees a lot of foot traffic.
  * A clean logo and an easy-to-remember website or phone number work best. Avoid cluttered designs that are hard to read from the street.
  * Busy intersections, neighborhood entrances, or nearby shopping centers can generate even more attention.


A well-placed yard sign doesn’t just mark your territory — it sparks curiosity and word-of-mouth buzz.
If you want signs that really make an impact, specializes in creating eye-catching yard signs that help you stand out. From classic designs to custom shapes, they’ll help you turn every jobsite into a powerful marketing tool. Great signs aren’t just about looking good — they’re about getting noticed, starting conversations, and bringing in more leads.
Your trucks and trailers are moving billboards. Whether they’re parked at a job site or driving across town, they’re constantly representing your brand.
  * A dirty, dented truck sends the wrong message about your attention to detail.
  * Logos, color schemes, and contact information should match across all vehicles for a polished, unified look.


First impressions start the moment you pull up to the curb.
It’s not just about the job site — it’s about the people on it too.
When your team shows up in matching hats, polos, and even branded paperwork (like estimate forms or leave-behinds), it shows a level of professionalism that customers notice right away.
A crew that looks organized gives customers more confidence that the work will be organized too.
Construction is messy by nature, but there’s a big difference between expected mess and total chaos.
  * Take extra care around flower beds, trees, and prized bushes — even noting special requests during the intake process.
  * A quick walk-around at the end of each day to tidy up can leave a lasting impression.


A clean, cared-for job site shows respect for the homeowner’s property and builds trust with the entire neighborhood.
One of the best ways to understand why job site branding matters so much is by looking at the ideas from the book by Harry Beckwith.
In industries like roofing and construction, customers don’t usually climb up and inspect every detail of your work. They aren’t checking chimney flashings, underlayment, or how perfectly aligned your shingles are. To them, most of the work you do is invisible.


All of these visible details send strong messages about your professionalism, your attention to detail, and how much pride you take in your work.
Even small things, like neat paperwork or a branded truck, can shape how trustworthy and capable your company seems. It’s not just about the finished product — it’s about the entire experience you create from the first glance to the final walk-through.
If you want customers to believe you’ll handle the work with care, you need to show them you care about the details too.
When it comes to job site branding, every little detail adds up. But if you really want to make a big impact, it helps to think bigger — and higher.
Most branding efforts stay on the ground with signs, vehicles, and uniforms. But what if you could take it up a level — literally? That’s where comes in.
VanBoxel offers that turns every rooftop into a massive, eye-catching billboard for your brand. Before the shingles are even installed, your logo or design is printed right onto the underlayment, giving you free advertising visible to neighbors, passersby, and anyone flying a drone overhead.
It’s a simple upgrade that makes a huge difference in how professional and established your company looks.
In other words, you’re not just getting better visibility — you’re also delivering a better product.
When every detail counts, VanBoxel’s custom underlayment helps you stand out from the crowd and show customers that you take pride in every layer of your work. 
While strong job site branding can make a huge impact, a few common mistakes can just as easily work against you. To make sure your efforts leave the right impression, watch out for these pitfalls:
  * Your logo should be clean, bold, and easy to recognize from a distance. Avoid overly detailed designs, small text, or anything that gets lost when printed on a sign, truck, or shirt. Simplicity almost always wins when it comes to brand recognition.
  * QR codes can be useful in the right context, but they’re often tricky on job sites. From the street or a passing car, it’s almost impossible for someone to scan a code on a moving truck or a distant sign. Stick with clear web addresses and easy-to-remember phone numbers instead.
  * If your trucks, signs, and uniforms all look different, it weakens your brand’s overall impact. Consistency is key. Make sure logos, colors, fonts, and messaging match across all of your marketing materials. When everything feels connected, your company looks bigger, more professional, and more trustworthy.


Getting the basics right will help you make a lasting impression — for all the right reasons.
Branding your job site isn’t just about looking polished — it’s one of the best forms of you have. Every clean, organized, and well-branded project builds trust with homeowners and turns neighbors and passersby into future customers.
Small details add up fast. Eye-catching yard signs from help you capture attention at the curb, system protects landscaping and boosts your professional image, and custom underlayment from shows off your brand from the rooftop — helping you stand out in a crowded market without spending extra on ads.
Remember: **Don’t just build a project. Build a brand that neighbors and clients trust at first glance.**

can be an excellent of . When you participate in trade shows, you can showcase your services to a large audience. This exposure can attract potential customers who are actively seeking .
Moreover, trade shows allow you to interact directly with attendees and build personal connections. By engaging in conversations and demonstrating your expertise, you can establish trust with potential leads. Collecting contact information at trade shows enables you to follow up after the event and continue nurturing those leads.
To boost , you can implement various strategies. Firstly, consider offering promotions or discounts to attract new customers. For example, providing a first-time customer discount can incentivize people to try your services.
Another effective way is by leveraging the power of satisfied customers. Encourage them to refer their friends and family by offering referral bonuses or discounts on future services for each successful referral they make. This not only brings in new leads but also helps in building trust through word-of-mouth recommendations.
Ensure your website is user-friendly and contains a clear calls to action, prompting visitors to contact you for services. Listing your phone number prominently on all platforms can also make it easier for potential customers to reach out when they need assistance.
If you belong to the ever-expanding network of home improvement professionals, you’ve probably heard of or used some common home improvement lead generation companies. Houzz, Home Advisor, , and Thumbtack are all companies that aid in getting the word out there for home improvement companies. The problem with many of these companies is that they piggyback off the beautiful design work of the clients using the platform to benefit their company growth.
Houzz is generally for more premium, high-end design. You might have difficulty competing on Houzz if you are not a visually pleasing, luxurious brand. The high-end clientele tends to go to Houzz. The initial account is free, but there is also a Pro+ account that you should watch out for because you may get some very aggressive notifications from Houzz wanting you to keep up with your account, upselling, etc. You don’t need to throw your money into the premium services they offer don’t. There is no real guarantee for leads featuring your designs and projects. I know of a contractor who put over $22,000 into their Houzz business account to avoid getting ONE lead. In many instances, your profile only makes them look good, without your best interest.
You may have heard nightmare stories of Home Advisor. It CAN work for smaller handyman companies needing to get off the ground. It’s good to communicate with other companies, but Home Advisor carries thousands of , despite having an A rating on BBB. Turns out a lot of money has been paid out to reverse poor reviews from companies who have left home advisor. That doesn’t sound like someone with your best interest in mind!
If you DO get a lead through Home Advisor, your best bet is to take that lead out of the app and embrace it outside the realm of Home Advisor. Leverage that lead and see if they have any referrals or other people needing your assistance. This helps to start generating your own business outside of a lead generation arena.
Getting charged a la carte for leads on Home Advisor is also an issue amongst users. For every ping on your phone that is a new lead, you could be charged $30-40 to your credit card. If you are seeing a lot of fees, for very little payoff, it’s time to get out.
Angie’s List is a great resource for finding local, top-rated, certified home service pros in several services. However, it does rely heavily on customer reviews, so a brand-new company may not necessarily have luck at first, but it may be worth utilizing the free tool.
Unfortunately, the company was recently acquired by Home Advisor so reviews are starting to trickle in regarding companies having the same issues with Angie’s List as they did with Home Advisor. Again, it’s a free profile with free review collection tools and a free message center. If you have a good website, good contact forms, and social media platforms you monitor regularly, you can keep Angie’s List out of the equation by removing new leads from that platform and working with them outside the app.
Thumbtack is a bit more competitive, as you may be getting a lead but competing for it against other companies. It’s like a physical message board where somebody posts that they are looking for this or that, and you have to reach out and snag that lead. I’ve heard of having great success with Thumbtack, but keep in mind it will take some due diligence on your part to be competitive in the landscape and grasp those leads as they come in.
A new concept in lead generation, NextDoor is a great tool for the handyman who is just starting out and wants to do small project-based work within their communities. It’s free and reliant on neighbors and people in the community. But it’s a great way to put yourself out there and get organic lead generation by putting in the effort.
The important thing is to be active in your lead generation. You want leads to knock on your door, not someone else’s where you need to compete with other companies. This is not to say that you shouldn’t use these other sites as well, but go for it! Put your information on all these free platforms and see what happens. You may just hit the right stride with one of these lead generation sites, and then it’s just a matter of trimming the fat and canceling the most expensive or the least active generators for your company.
Remember, building your brand equity goes hand in hand with lead generation. Paving your path regarding where you get leads, which leads you to chase, and how you gain those leads matters for long-term brand equity. When you rely heavily on home improvement lead generation companies, you are building brand – when you should put those resources towards building brand.

If you’re a service-based business in industries like , , or , Google offer a fantastic way to connect with potential customers actively searching for your services. However, like any advertising platform, LSAs require ongoing management to get the best return on investment.

LSA management involves overseeing and optimizing all aspects of your Google Local Service Ads to ensure they’re driving quality leads and performing efficiently. From setting up your profile and managing ads to disputing leads and earning the , there are multiple layers to managing LSAs effectively.


Let’s break down each aspect of LSA management in more detail.
The foundation of any successful LSA campaign begins with setting up a comprehensive business profile. This includes your company name, service area, contact information, hours of operation, and most importantly—your customer reviews. Google uses this information to connect your business with users searching for services in your area.
: Optimize your profile by ensuring your business categories are correct, keeping your hours updated, and actively encouraging satisfied customers to leave reviews. Positive reviews can significantly impact your ad’s performance since users tend to choose businesses with strong ratings.
  * : Google places your business above regular search results, boosting visibility.
  * : Your reviews and Google Guaranteed badge help build immediate trust with potential customers.


  * : Unlike traditional Google Ads, you can’t fully customize your ad copy or presentation. Your business will appear in a standard format.


Once your profile is up, the next step in is creating and running ads. Unlike traditional Google Ads, LSAs don’t require keyword bidding. Instead, Google uses its algorithms to display your ads based on your service area and customer needs. Your ad will feature basic details like your rating, number of reviews, and whether your business has the Google Guarantee badge.
: Consistently monitor the performance of your ads by tracking impressions, clicks, and leads. Make adjustments as necessary, such as updating your service area or adjusting your ad availability for different times of day based on demand.
  * : LSAs automatically match your business with relevant customer searches, making it simpler to manage.
  * : You only pay per qualified lead, meaning you don’t waste money on users who aren’t likely to convert.


  * : Google’s algorithm determines when and where your ad is displayed, which can sometimes feel less customizable than PPC campaigns.


One of the most important aspects of is handling the leads generated by your ads. Since LSAs operate on a pay-per-lead model, it’s crucial to review each lead to ensure it’s qualified. Google defines a “qualified lead” as someone who reaches out for services that you offer and is within your service area.
: If a lead is deemed unqualified (e.g., someone outside your service area or requesting services you don’t provide), you have the ability to dispute it. Disputing unqualified leads can save you money by ensuring you’re only paying for genuine inquiries.
  * : Paying per lead ensures you’re only charged for meaningful customer interactions.
  * : You can easily dispute irrelevant or low-quality leads, giving you more control over your ad spend.


  * : While LSAs aim to connect you with highly relevant leads, there can be some variation in quality, making disputes a necessary part of management.


The is one of the strongest selling points of LSAs. To become a Google Guaranteed business, Google requires that you pass a background check, confirm your business license, and provide proof of insurance. Earning this badge signals to potential customers that your business is trustworthy and that Google will offer refunds if they are unsatisfied with the service, up to a specific amount.
: Ensure all your credentials are up-to-date and that your business remains compliant with Google’s requirements. Once your business is Google Guaranteed, maintaining that status through ongoing updates and compliance is key to retaining the trust and visibility the badge offers.
  * : The Google Guarantee badge instantly boosts customer confidence, making them more likely to contact your business.
  * : Not all businesses in your industry may have the badge, giving you a distinct edge in the search results.


  * : Getting Google Guaranteed can take time and effort, and businesses that don’t meet the criteria will miss out on this added layer of credibility.


Despite the many benefits, there are some common challenges businesses face with LSA management. Recognizing these obstacles can help you prepare for more effective ad management.
  1. : Some industries, like HVAC or plumbing, may have a lot of competition for LSAs, making it harder to stand out.
  2. : Depending on your location, you may receive too many leads during peak seasons, which can strain your ability to respond quickly.
  3. : Since Google controls much of the process (e.g., when your ad is shown), businesses accustomed to the control of traditional Google Ads may find LSAs restrictive.


Effective requires a balance of setting up your profile, monitoring ad performance, disputing leads, and ensuring your business maintains the badge. Each of these components plays a critical role in ensuring that your business receives qualified leads and maximizes its visibility and trustworthiness.
While LSAs offer a simpler, more streamlined approach to advertising, they still require careful attention and regular management to make sure they deliver the best possible return on investment.

If you’re a home service business looking to generate more local leads, offer one of the most efficient ways to connect with ready-to-buy customers — right at the moment they’re searching for your services.


Whether you’re new to or looking to get more value from your existing campaigns, this resource will give you clear, actionable steps to dominate local search.
Local Services Ads, sometimes called , are a advertising platform from Google. Unlike traditional Google Ads (pay-per-click), you only pay when a potential customer through the ad.
These ads are positioned standard Google Ads in search results, making them highly visible. 


This placement, combined with Google’s trust signals, makes LSAs incredibly powerful for driving high-quality leads. This service connects local businesses with potential customers who are actively seeking the services these businesses provide. It’s a great way to generate leads, improve visibility, and enhance your online reputation.
  1. : First, you need to set up your LSA by providing business details, defining the service areas, and specifying the job types your business caters to.
  2. : After setting up your ad, Google will conduct a screening process that includes checking your business license, insurance, and reviews. In certain industries, this process may also include employee background checks. If you pass, you’ll earn the “Google Guaranteed” badge.
  3. : Once approved, your LSA will start appearing in relevant local searches. Customers can click on your ad to call you directly or send a message requesting your service.
  4. : Unlike traditional Google Ads where you pay per click, with LSAs you pay per lead. This means you only pay when a potential customer gets in touch directly through the ad.
  5. : If a customer isn’t satisfied with the quality of your work, Google may cover the service invoice amount under the Google Guarantee, which can be up to $2,000 for lifetime coverage.


Remember, LSAs are not a replacement for traditional or Google Ads but rather a supplement to these strategies. They provide another way to get your business in front of potential customers, build trust with the Google Guaranteed badge, and only pay when you get a viable lead.
For and businesses, LSAs can be particularly effective given the local nature of these industries. By properly setting up and optimizing your LSA, you can connect with more local customers, grow your business, and boost your online reputation.
Once your business is verified, you earn the , which plays a huge role in customer decision-making.
**Here’s a Google Guaranteed Badge for your website – increasing trust there!**
_Right click on the image and press “save as” then add to your site in a prominent spot to get even more out of your Google Guaranteed status!_
Including the Google Guaranteed badge on your website can significantly influence the decision-making process of potential customers and increase leads for a number of reasons:
  1. : The Google Guaranteed badge signals that your business has been thoroughly vetted and approved by Google. This can greatly enhance your credibility and trustworthiness in the eyes of potential customers, making them more likely to choose your services over competitors.
  2. : The Google Guarantee, which covers services up to a certain amount, provides a safety net for customers. Knowing that Google will cover the cost if they’re unsatisfied with the work helps mitigate the perceived risk of choosing your business, which can be particularly persuasive in industries like roofing or home services where the cost of services can be high.
  3. : Displaying the badge on your website makes it stand out in a crowded market. It catches the eye of site visitors and can lead to increased engagement and higher conversion rates.
  4. : Not all businesses qualify for the Google Guaranteed program. If you have the badge and your competitors don’t, this can give you a significant advantage and make you the preferred choice for customers.
  5. : The badge is a testament to the quality of your work. It shows potential customers that you’re committed to delivering high-quality services, which can be a powerful selling point.


By including the Google Guaranteed badge on your website, you’re leveraging Google’s brand to enhance your own. It’s a persuasive tool that can help convert site visitors into leads and ultimately into loyal customers.
At Hook Agency, we’ve consistently seen LSAs drive for our clients in industries like , , and .
  * click on Local Services Ads during a search.
  * tend to call or message immediately, leading to faster sales cycles.


The businesses that see the best results are those who set up and optimize their profiles carefully — and continue refining them based on performance data.
Certainly, optimizing your Local Services Ads (LSA) or Google Guaranteed program can help you increase the output of leads and make the most out of your budget. Here are some best practices to achieve this:
  1. : A complete and well-detailed business profile can increase your chances of being picked by customers. Ensure all information about your business, including hours of operation, services offered, and service areas, is accurate and up to date.
  2. : Reviews play a vital role in the LSA ranking algorithm. The more positive reviews you have, the higher your ad will rank. Encourage satisfied customers to leave a review on your Google My Business profile. Respond to reviews, both positive and negative, in a professional and timely manner to show that you value customer feedback.
  3. : Adding high-quality photos to your profile can increase engagement with your ads. Make sure the images accurately represent your business and the quality of work you deliver.
  4. : If you’re not getting enough leads, consider expanding your service areas. This will increase the number of potential customers who see your ads. But remember, make sure you can deliver quality service in the new areas before adding them.
  5. : If your ads are not spending as fast as you’d like, you may need to increase your weekly budget. The higher your budget, the more leads you can potentially receive.
  6. : Make sure you’re targeting the right job types that are relevant to your business. You can add more job types to attract a broader audience or focus on specific job types that bring in the most profitable jobs.
  7. : If available in your area and business category, use Google’s booking feature. This allows customers to book your services directly from the ad, making it easier for them to choose your business.
  8. : Providing excellent service will not only help you get good reviews but also increase the chances of your customers choosing your business again in the future, leading to more leads in the long run.
  9. : Regularly check your LSA dashboard to track your ad performance. Use this data to make necessary adjustments to your ads and budget.
  10. : If you receive leads that are not valid (for example, wrong numbers, solicitations, or requests for services you don’t offer), you can dispute them within the LSA platform. If Google agrees that the lead is invalid, you won’t be charged for it.


Remember, LSAs are about more than just visibility—they’re about building trust. The Google Guaranteed badge signals to customers that your business is reliable and trustworthy, so all these efforts should go hand-in-hand with providing top-notch service to your customers.

and aren’t competing strategies — they’re two sides of the same coin, each playing a critical role in the customer journey.
Here’s how they work together across the key stages of your marketing funnel:
  * : Paid search, like Local Services Ads (LSAs), puts your business directly in front of customers actively searching for your services. It creates instant visibility at the top of search results, helping you capture attention early.
  * : Once potential customers are aware of you, organic search (through SEO and content marketing) educates them. Blog posts, service pages, and FAQs answer their questions and build trust.
  * : As customers compare options, both paid ads and organic content influence their decision. Strong reviews, a credible website, and consistent branding across ads and organic listings make your business the obvious choice.
  * : When it’s time to hire or buy, customers often revisit businesses they’ve seen multiple times — through ads, organic listings, or both. Paid search ensures you’re visible when intent is highest, while organic trust signals (like reviews and quality content) help close the deal.


**Paid search drives immediate, high-intent traffic. Organic search builds long-term trust and authority.** When used together strategically, they create a full-funnel marketing engine that accelerates leads, sales, and business growth.
> Companies that invest in both paid and organic strategies typically see better ROI than those relying on just one channel.

## How did Josh Swisher hit $10M revenue in one year at 32 years old?
To be clear – we’re always just a component of our clients overall strategy. That being said – Josh Swisher has often said part of his ‘secret sauce’ is his marketing edge, and Hook Agency is a pretty big part of that cutting edge. 
  * We designed an initial website, and then designed another one more recently 2-3 years ago – both redesigns gave a more professional appearance to Northface than so many roofers in his area.
  * We’ve helped Josh go from nearly 0 traffic to 10’s of thousands of visitors monthly, with just organic traffic.
  * We built out a ton of location landing pages, netting 100’s of clicks monthly for ‘near me’ searches, and driving up leads from organic traffic.
  * We’ve helped Josh push his overall lead count into thousands yearly.


### $30,000 of organic traffic coming to Northface’s website every month, even if they stopped SEO
We know what we’re doing when it comes to generating a ridiculously high amount of leads for the companies we serve.
  * When we took over Google ad management they were getting upwards of $300 – $400 a lead, and we got that down to under $150 and allowed them to get more leads for way less money.
  * We know the world of marketing is complex, but now we’re able to share what’s working for 50 roofers around the country, allowing us to provide a network effect for our clients, to make your marketing money go further. 
  * Yes, SEO takes time – but after 3-4 years of Search engine optimization, Northface is getting 30k worth of traffic – as evidenced by Ahrefs ‘Traffic Value’ – which translates what they would have to spend in Google ads, to get the traffic they are getting from SEO. If they stopped SEO – this traffic would continue to drive leads. Instead they’ve chosen to continue investing so the results compound.

You’re sick of paying for garbage leads that don’t even answer when you call.
You’re ready to do the REAL, HARD stuff consistently that creates consistent massive amount of leads on autopilot.
Seriously. There’s no life raft of shortcuts coming to save your business. And no agency — including mine — is gonna be your miracle if you’re not showing up consistently, doing the hard stuff that works.
Hi, I’m — founder of Hook Agency. We’ve helped over 100 companies generate tens of thousands of leads, and I’m writing this on a beautiful Black Friday morning instead of running a “limited-time offer” ad.
Because this is a gift to the industry — not a pitch.
Inside this, I’m sharing the best stuff we’ve learned. The same plays we’ve run to help our clients double or even triple their leads.
If you take this seriously — if you what I’m about to recommend — this could be the turning point you’ve been waiting for.
  * to start getting leads from the internet with no to low budget.
  * that if implemented will transform your business into a lead generation engine.
  * **The NEW way to market a roofing company for 2025** – utilizing the latest surging trends, the best A.I. tools, and turning your sales team into a creative engine that feeds marketing what it needs to ( Hint: You want your leads to come to your company 80% closed already if they are watching your marketing.)


Google Business Profile, Local Service Ads, and Facebook Groups aren’t optional — they’re the holy trinity of low-cost, high-impact lead generation.
If you’re tight on budget, this is where you . And even if you’ve got money to burn, these three channels should still be before you ever touch a fancy marketing funnel or agency retainer.
It’s not about hacks. It’s about doing the simple stuff 
Let’s break down exactly how to squeeze every lead out of each platform:
  * Make sure you’re utilizing all the space they allow on the description. Utilizing keywords and cities you serve and any other key information.
  * Choose all of the cities you serve, and your service area carefully. 
  * Get as many reviews as you possibly can, create automations in your business, and do contests between your sales people to see who can get the most reviews (have them ask the customer to mention by name and the likelihood goes up!) 
  * Post on Google Business Profile at least once a week, with the different services you want to rank for. 


(We do have a if you want to get more aggressive with this, that includes automations from your CRM to your Google Business Profile – all designed to help you rank higher on maps more consistently. )
**We use maps like this to see where you’re currently ranking in your area, and try to help you rank higher in maps in more spots near you** :
####  Ideas to Get More 5-Star Reviews on Your Google Business Profile
Reviews are the rocket fuel for your Google Business Profile — more visibility, more trust, more leads.
Here’s how to get them without begging or being weird:
**1. Text Every Customer the Review Link — Right After the Job**
Timing is everything. Catch them while the gratitude is fresh and they’re still wow’d. Use a short, friendly message like:
> “Hey [Name], it was awesome working with you! Would you mind sharing your experience here? It helps us a ton: [link]”
Your installers, techs, or reps are the real MVPs — if they did a great job, they’ve that ask. Keep it simple: “Hey, if we made your day a little better, would you mind leaving us a quick Google review?”
Slap it on invoices, leave-behinds, or a “thank you” card. Make it stupid easy.
Some people love you. Let them go wild. Ask if they’ll leave one — and again on Facebook or NextDoor.
Don’t pay customers for reviews — that’s a no-no. But DO gamify it for your team: $10 for every review with their name in it. Public shoutouts. Monthly leaderboard.
If they didn’t leave one after the first ask? Follow up once 3-5 days later with a warm reminder. Keep it human.
And they show up right at the top of Google Search results. 
So it makes sense that you might want to dominate that area of the search results if you can.
So every single roofer should be on there, and maxing out the spend they can if they are getting legit deals from it:
  * Set your categories, location areas, and budget (set it high, it likely won’t spend it all.)
  * Continue monitoring the quality of leads, and make sure you’re responding in a super timely way.


If you want, we have a whole you can take! 
They don’t even have their company name in their bio.
You could EXPLOIT that and be the super-involved roofer that 
  * instead of posting just promotion all the time. 
  * instead of letting your friend list stagnate.
  * for all your sales people and messaging when someone is looking for a roofer.
  * when someone’s looking for another home service business, insurance agent or realtor._*(Obviously this helps them remember you when someone’s looking for a roofer too.)_


You do not want to be over-dependent on one roofing marketing technique.
It can be terrible if for some reason that goes down. Let’s say you rock at Facebook ads, and then Facebook changes it’s targeting and it’s suddenly way less effective – 
Don’t be naive – each of these will either take time, money, energy or effort.
**Here they are in the order I would do them based on quickness to results, and timeline if you’re new:**
When I started Hook Agency 8 years ago, I didn’t have a marketing budget. I had $20K, a half-decent network, and an appetite for Chipotle.
So I made a plan: one lunch, every weekday, for a month — with someone who had influence over the customers I wanted.
If you’re in roofing, , , pest control — your marketing budget should absolutely include lunches, coffees, and casual hangs with:


Whether it’s through BNI, Chamber events, or sliding into local Facebook groups, your job is to consistently get in front of the people who already own the attention of your ideal customers.
And this isn’t just about collecting business cards — it’s about giving value 
  * If they love them, ask for an intro. If not, recommend one of your partners.
  * Become a source of business for your referral partners. Reciprocity will 
  * Minimum: 2 lunches per week.


Shoot a short video together. Post it. Tag them. Promote The more useful you are in public, the more people want to partner privately.
Stay generous. Stay consistent. And watch the referrals roll in.
Every job is a marketing opportunity — don’t waste it.
Truck wraps. Yard signs. Branded . These aren’t just nice-to-haves — they’re some of the you can deploy.
The closer your branding is to the job site, the more credibility it carries. It’s not just advertising — it’s proof. It’s that your company shows up, delivers, and takes pride in the work.
####  Pro Tip: Fix Your Name and Logo if They Suck
If your business name is , and your logo is , all of your local marketing — yard signs, wraps, Catch-Alls — works 10x harder. Word of mouth starts with name recognition. Don’t make it hard for people to refer you.
You don’t have to be a full-time door knocker — but ignoring the houses right next to your current job is just leaving money on the table.
Anytime you’re running a lead or doing an install, hit the **3 houses to the left, 3 to the right, and 3 across the street.** That’s the 
> “Hey there — just helping out your neighbor with their roof. Wanted to see if you’ve had anyone look at yours recently. No pressure — I can hop up, give you a free inspection, and if everything looks good, I’ll give you a clean bill of health.”
> “Your neighbor’s roof is getting covered by insurance — likely from the same storm. Happy to take a look at yours real quick to see if there’s any damage. It’s no cost to you, and I’ll be honest either way.”
You’re not just another stranger knocking. You’re That proximity builds instant trust — and it multiplies the value of every lead and every job you already have.
You don’t need a PhD to run Google Ads for roofing. But you need to avoid the common landmines that waste your budget.
Start simple: target only the areas you actually want to service. Keep your radius tight. Focus on your top converting keywords — things like “roof replacement [city],” “roof repair near me,” “storm damage roofing,” etc. 
We manage , and here are a few of the biggest keys to success:
Don’t lump everything into one campaign. Roof repair, roof replacement, and storm restoration each deserve their own campaign with custom ads and landing pages.
Skip and — or at the very least, keep a close eye on lead quality. These formats can send your budget to weird places fast.
Google wants to spend your money. Don’t let them optimize for you blindly. Turn off auto-applied suggestions in settings.
This is where most burn cash. Add negative keywords like “Home Depot shingles,” “DIY roof,” or “rooftop bar” — anything that clearly doesn’t lead to a paying job.
If you’re not running Facebook ads, you’re leaving brand awareness and warm leads on the table.
You should have a basic running — a strong headline, a compelling offer (think: “$500 Off Roof Replacement” or “Free Roof Inspections”), and geo-targeting to your top zip codes.
But when storms hit? That’s when you go full — swap in storm-specific messaging like:
> “Your neighbors are getting their roofs covered by insurance — yours might be too. Free same-day inspections.”
These timely, hyper-local ads get clicks, calls, and conversions fast when urgency is high
Shoot 2–3 video testimonials (iPhone is fine to start) and run them locally 24/7. These aren’t just “nice to have” — they and make every other lead gen strategy cheaper. Real homeowners. Real trust.
Add the Facebook Pixel to your website (or have your web team do it). Then run ads to who visited your site in the past 7, 30, or 60 days. It’s like tapping them on the shoulder after they ghosted your site.
for more tips on how to maximize your return from Facebook ads.
You can’t just spend a bunch of money on one-time, and rank for the rest of your life.
And anyone that tells you different, is just trying to sell you a course. 
**Here are the basic activities of Google SEO – that you can do yourself, or have a company like us do (150+ 5-Star Google Reviews):**
  * for all of the cities and towns you serve, make sure the keyword you want to rank for [City Name] + Roofing is at the front of the ‘Meta Title’ (with a tool like Rankmath or Yoast SEO on WordPress)
  * **Get 3-5 Really good backlinks from other websites as soon as possible,** get local directory listings, and make sure the backlinks are generally linking back with your brand name, the URL, and rarely on the best links with the keyword you want to rank for. 
  * by ‘de-indexing’ things like testimonials, and other weird custom post types (often created incidentally by WordPress themes) with a tool like RankMath. And make sure the website is lightning fast with a pagespeed plugin like Optimole. 


If all of these things seem a little complicated – it’s all good!
We do this for 75+ roofing companies around the country – and can do it for you.
– we do blogging, , competitive analysis and earn backlinks monthly, report on everything we completed and the leads created, while offering best in class website design and customer service.
– You can learn how to do all of this on our where I outline the exact steps I took to make a basic WordPress website and rank it to the point my friend said it was making this phone ring off the hook, even though it was an experiment website. LOL. 
Most people are making their roofing video marketing WAY too complicated.
That’s why you should stop making stupid nonsense videos that are just about getting views, and focus on SALES ENABLEMENT videos instead.
  * from your sales team – and address them empathetically one by one in videos that you can then share with prospects, clarify and simplify your responses to, and utilize to even train your new sales reps on the official company response to these kinds of ‘objections.’ SCALE YOUR BEST CLOSER – don’t just have some disinterested second tier salesperson or college intern make these videos.
  * Answer the top 7 Questions people have in the sales process
  * Ask variations of the question ‘Why are you more expensive’ and talk about real reasons, things that affect price, and utilize a

Then you can blend these attention grabbing hooks back into your content – and start finding a way to blend VIEWS and SALES ENABLEMENT. 
You’ve got the basics humming — leads are coming in, your Google Business Profile is loaded with reviews, your yard signs are showing up on every install.
This is where you stop … and start building a system that brings them in automatically.
Posting is fine. Necessary, even. But posting alone is like putting up a billboard in the desert — nobody’s around to see it.
The real power on social comes from — one that knows your name, trusts your brand, and is more likely to refer you when the time is right.
Use this method daily or weekly to build real visibility in your community:
  * Look up local hashtags, geo-tags, Facebook groups, or even the followers of realtors or insurance agents in your area.
  * Be generous. Be visible. Liking posts keeps you top of mind, and it’s a low-effort way to show up consistently in people’s notifications.
  * Go beyond “Nice!” or emojis. Leave meaningful replies, tag someone who might help, or drop helpful info. The goal: 


This activity isn’t just “social media.” It’s 
You’re training the algorithm and your audience at the same time.
  * The algorithm sees you as active and relevant, boosting your visibility.
  * Your local market sees you as engaged, helpful, and human — not just another sales-hungry roofer.


People do business with people they recognize. And people refer businesses they feel connected to.
This method creates , which is the , trust, and low-cost leads down the road.
Once you’re past $5M in revenue, it’s not just about “getting more leads” — it’s about and building a machine that works without you.
This is when you shift from … to building a small, smart team that can scale attention, referrals, and reputation.

Keep their focus on . They make sure things get done — even if or freelancers are executing the details.


The goal is . This person keeps your brand visible and relatable on every platform.

> Your internal team runs the playbook.Your external partners run the plays.
You’re a — with the potential to be powered by smart tech.
The new wave of growth-mode roofing companies are leaning into this. They’re rolling out the red carpet:
  * Texting when they’re en route, with a photo of the project consultant.
  * Gifting customers after the roof install to spark raving fan referrals.


They’re using automation not to cut corners — but to enhance 
  * CRMs that alert you when it’s time to check in, upsell, or ask for a review.
  * Tech that makes the whole process feel smooth, modern, and elevated — even luxury.

Remember, every star in your rating counts, every customer’s voice matters, and every response can make a difference. Whether you are a marketer seeking ways to enhance your brand’s image or a consumer attempting to make an informed purchasing decision, the power of online reviews is undeniable.
In the end, the key takeaway is this: Embrace the transparency of the digital age. Be proactive in managing your online reputation. Prioritize customer satisfaction and remember that in the realm of online reviews, every customer interaction is an opportunity to show the world the best your business has to offer. Harness the power of online reviews and let them be the stepping stones to your business success.

What would an endless flow of leads pouring into your business do for your company? This guide will give you the exact steps that led to companies getting high-value leads, without paid ads or paying sheister companies like HomeAdvisor for bad leads.
  * Reviews, referrals, and Google My Business are a huge part of the game.
  * Learn the basics of SEO + try various lead gen services.
  * Move into PPC ads, Google local services, remarketing and trim your efforts down to only the MOST effective.


Are you ignoring the biggest ‘quick indicator’ for most homeowners on whether or not your company is legitimate and professional?
The first mistake many plumbers make is considering these things to be trivial – you can not overestimate the importance of 10-20+ glowing on Google in particular.
You don’t have to have a perfect 5-stars, but pushing on getting more, and making sure your rating is above 4.5, will significantly increase your chances of getting the call – if it’s between you and another provider.
Create systems for your people to ask every time, after a great interaction with a customer.
Once you get your reviews in place, you can also create systems around getting more referrals. Most people aren’t necessarily automatically thinking about who you might also help that they know – but if you ask, perhaps around the time you ask for a review, you’ll help remind them that small businesses rely on referrals and word of mouth.
Ask for one referral via e-mail every time you have a successfully completed job.
Besides reviews – making sure you have a completed Google My Business profile, filled to the brim with keywords and that you are regularly active on there.
  1. Enter every single field that Google offers while you’re setting up your GMB listing.
  2. Include the keywords you want to rank for in your descriptions.
  3. Add Photos that showcase your personality, and the interior and exterior of your space.


Some of these may seem a little hard to understand but look into them more and will seriously increase your rankings on Google:


The biggest new player in the game is Google local services ads – and any smart company is jumping all over this new method.
Doing Google can really drain your business of cash unless you know what you’re doing. That’s why I suggest doing ‘Expanded Exact Match Keywords’ – which uses [brackets around your keywords] to make sure that every single keyword you include has to be present in a search for your site’s ads to show up.
Why is this important? Because if not – you start showing up for something you didn’t want to show up for since Google expands your keywords out way too far if you don’t keep a tight circle around the things you DO want to show up for.
Also – I strongly suggest going in and adding negative keywords every couple weeks until you get your ads ONLY showing up for the things you want them to.
NextDoor app is the best possible service companies right now.
The other one that is working well for some – is Thumbtack but always do small tests to start and respond to leads as quickly as you possibly can.
Avoid getting stuck in a place where these are the only leads you’re getting because you might end up in a ‘race to the bottom’ for pricing – and not sell on a premium basis.
Content marketing is massive – particularly if you identify a tight niche of customers you want to go after. You can create landing pages that go after cities and sub-services, but then you also want to build out answers to common questions, and constantly be looking for new ways to get in front of customers. This is massive for getting higher on Google as Google loves fresh content on websites, but also these pieces of content are great for social and staying in front of existing customers and referral partners.
If there’s one thing I’d strongly suggest doing as far as paid advertising goes, besides ‘local services ads’ it’s remarketing. It takes most people 7 times to see your company before they contact you – so if they come to your site make sure they see your ads all over afterward by using remarketing ads.
The only way you’re going to get endless leads on autopilot is if you take massive action for the success of your business.
No magic pill is going to create the business of your dreams, and in fact – (as many companies have realized with companies like HomeAdvisor) if they act like their method will be a cure-all – it might be actually more likely to harm your business than help it.
I suggest companies double-down on ‘sweat equity’ in regards to these 9 lead-generation tips. Take 100% responsibility for your business’ success, stop blaming [plumbing lead generation services, and start generating your own plumbing leads – particularly by digging into plumbing SEO](https://hookagency.com/plumbing-seo/) tips.

**Thank you for reading! Be sure to check out our other marketing resources for plumbers**
A plumber can promote their business in a variety of ways. First, make sure the company has claimed its Google business listing. Find the plumbing business on Google maps, claim and verify it, and input the plumber’s business contact information so clients can find you on maps. Alone or with the help of a marketing agency, a plumber can set up a website for their business. The website should be optimized to rank well in Google search (SEO) so that prospective clients in the area see the website when they search keywords related to plumbing services. Another easy way to promote a plumbing business is social media. Create business media accounts for sites like Facebook and Instagram or local business reviews sites like Yelp or Angi. Having an online presence is a considerable credit to the number of clients who can find your services. You can also promote using positive online customer reviews.
To get more plumbing service calls, a plumber should first ensure that their professional reputation is satisfactory. To increase the amount of word-of-mouth promotion and local service calls, gather reviews from nearby clients and advertise using local businesses your clients already know. A plumber can also team up with a marketing professional or marketing team to try and drive leads and clicks to their website. A website that isn’t bringing in any new clients is probably not ranking well in SEO. If the plumber has an established business but has no content promoting the business on social media, they are already missing out on prospective clients. If that doesn’t work, online paid advertisements will also boost views and clicks. Finally, look at older homes and neighborhoods in the area, as they are more likely to need plumbing maintenance or repair done than recently remodeled or built homes.
If you’re looking to start an entirely new plumbing business online, the first thing to do is set up a professional and easily navigable website that clients can easily access. Double-check that your pricing, contact information, services offered, and where your business is located are all included on the website. Then, develop a strategy for content marketing and paid search engine advertisements. It’s a good idea to work with a marketing team if you have little to no experience with search engine optimization, promotion, or building a professional online persona. A marketing team will also help you build content that uses keywords frequently used in your area. Gather any client feedback and reviews you have, and put them together somewhere clients can see them on your website. If you’ve claimed your Google business listing, check there for reviews or client recommendations and share those on all of your marketing platforms.
Plumbers get customers through word of mouth, client recommendations, and third-party leads like realtors, brokers, or construction managers. They also gain clients through local and online promotions. While plumbing companies and plumbers used to go door to door, most promotions are online now. For example, if the plumber is in an area with a lot of commercial buildings, they might get customers through realtors or construction managers that are building in the area. If the plumber is working in a location with many upcoming homes, they might get customers from the realtor. Both local and online promotion is crucial to helping plumbers get more customers. Since plumbing is a skill that is always required, plumbers may have an easier time finding customers locally. However, online promotion and a quality website are always crucial to finding clients. Sending brochures to potential clients’ homes that detail plumbing services are still a viable marketing solution.
If you’re looking to grow or expand a service company like plumbing, the key is to exceed the expectations of your clients, be professionally accessible, and be diligent about your digital marketing strategy. Partnering with a marketing agency makes this simple. A plumber can come out of the gate with a well-planned marketing strategy specific to the needs of their plumbing business with the help of a marketing company or professional. While marketing or promotion can be an extra cost, digital marketing is crucial for success. Try to make sure your professional website and other online media are written for SEO, and choose a company that can direct high authority backlinks to your site. Any existing client feedback or referrals should be advertised and easily found on your website. With the right digital marketing tools getting leads as a plumber should become automated and uncomplicated.

  *   *   * 

website inspiration is a little harder to come by on average, as a lot of websites look out-dated.
  * Maybe you don’t think that your plumbing website has to be cutting-edge.
  * Perhaps your competitor’s sites look way more unprofessional than yours.
  * Maybe you’re already successful and you don’t see what value a custom website might have.
  * We create gorgeous plumbing websites and offer to help plumbers get higher on Google.


We decided to curate 5 awesome plumbing of companies who invested in their websites, leading to better and more high-quality leads.
We’ll give you what we like and what we don’t like about each example, and then share 5 keys to making sure your plumbing website is as likely to convert website visitors into leads as possible, below the examples.
Each of these exemplifies something we strongly suggest for people trying to get more leads on their plumbing website!
We collaborated very closely with this company ensuring everything they dreamed of having on their website was incoporated – and as you can see we came up with this powerful, and highly focused and plumbing website design:
  * Reviews right up top in a way that feels widgetized and authentic.
  * “Key differentiating features” such as same-day service and installation guaranteed, Lifetime Guarantee, and Financing and Quick approvals. 
  * A big ‘Book Appointment’ button right away, and on every page in the header


We love this site because it showcases family-centered imagery and a lead form right away, while icons showcase key differentiating features of the plumbing company. 
**More importantly than the beautiful plumbing website design – is the 10x increase in keywords and traffic 6 months into working with Thelen Mechanical.**
What’s working well: We completely overhauled the look of this website, bringing it into the 2020’s, and giving it a look that better reflects the quality of the companies services. 
> “What a wonderful experience working with everyone on the Hook team! Everyone is very engaged and focused in making our web site and project successful. Its been 6 months and the results we are getting are phenomenal! So much that we just engaged with Hook to build and develop another web site for us. Awesome experience!” 
> – A Google Review from 4Front Energy (Paladdin’s parent company)
Right away we have the trust factors – in the ratings right next to the form. The form is up top, and ‘Request service is emphasized.’ Key bullet points are easy to read, and getting started is quick and easy. (If you need a plumbing website – build by professionals, .)
> “Hook Agency is a great company to work with. Easy to deal with and very good at what they do. They increased our web traffic substantially and got our phones ringing. I highly recommend this company.”
The smiling faces, easy to get started call-to-action, and the 4 main services all clear and right away – complements the modern, fresh – full-width design.
‘There’s a reason they call us Mr.’ has to be one of the weirder / more vague taglines I’ve seen in quite a long time. A good reminder that the MESSAGING on your site is just as It needs to be persuasive and clear. “If you confuse, you lose.”
What simplicity does is make the things that ARE there stand out more, that’s why you don’t want a website that feels ‘cluttered.’
The problem here is that the design is so simple that there might be a few more things visitors would need before making a request. Trade organizations, a clear phone number, pictures of the team, sub-services and process for instance.
The brand here is strong – and gives a very pleasant ‘vintage feel.’ Yes, Williams does a lot more than just plumbing, but the design is simple enough. and the site laid out well enough – it doesn’t overwhelm you.
There are a couple of very boring sections on this site – where they’ve just crammed in a bunch of text. The reason for this is to give Google a way to know what the services they offer are (text is good for ) but there are a lot of ways that a plumbing website can do this without it feeling just like a huge chunk of text on the site, like alternating images on the left and right at least.
The number right away, the easy search and the quick bullet points of the process are all super useful for the average homeowner just looking to get quick service.
We really like big smiling faces, and something that indicates the service right away in an image. In this case the photo is heavily overlayed, but honestly – this whole site is very well done.
The feels a little heavy and not particularly trustworthy – I’m not sure you want brown as the main color if you’re a plumber.
Having a beautiful plumbing website might not be enough to really drive new sales.
Certainly you want to have the basics in place, here’s 3 I suggest on every website:
  * A reviews carousel, with who left the review and the logo of where it was left, with a 5-star icon.
  * At least 500 words on each selling page so search engines have context, and people can get the important information they need.
  * Headlines and images that are focused on happy customers, and how the company helps solve their problem (not focused on how cool the company is.)


Great photos – ideally means they are original photos, but that takes time and effort to get, so if nothing else, make sure the photos aren’t cheesy old stock photos, make sure they feel modern and not of a too-clean or ‘overused’ style.
I strongly suggest working with a professional on a custom website design, and my favorite platform is WordPress, because it’s best in class for , and it’s open source so people are always creating new add-on’s for it that are great for marketing.
That being said – it’s hard getting started on that, so if you are going to make it yourself, I might suggest:
  1. – clean templates, spacious and sparse. Perhaps start with the .
  2. – ton’s of options. Perhaps start with the from Roomy Themes.
  3. – Older design / look – but there are plumber options like the Plumber .


If you can find someone to help, or you’re willing to put in 20 hours learning the basics of using a WordPress template or theme – here are 5 WordPress themes for plumbers to consider:


But Tim – why are you sharing all these cheap WordPress themes for plumbers?
Aren’t you scared that will make people not want to buy your custom website services?
  * Our best customers have tried templated websites before and decided they wanted to go the professional route by the time they get to us.
  * If your website could mean the difference between a slow season and your phone ringing off the hook, it makes sense to spend more. Totally possible – when we do Search Engine Optimization for clients, just look at what Jim Alberts of AJ Alberts Plumbing said about our services:


We handle blogging and landing page writing for Plumbing companies, but we don’t suggest having an outside company write your main selling pages, and the about pages on your website – why?
  * You should actually put your personality into your main page content.
  * Focus on your best customers and write a ‘sales letter’ to them, pretend like you’re talking to one customer.
  * Share examples of happy customers, and boil the main BENEFITS into headlines and bullet points so people can skim.
  * But certainly – try to make sure that each key page has at least 500 words on it for Search Engine Optimization purposes.


If you do decide to work with a professional plumbing website design company – make sure they have a lot of great 5-star reviews!
We work with a lot of trade / companies and have 50+ five-star reviews on Google.
If you are looking for a company that will listen to you – and create a modern, search engine friendly website design for your plumbing company, send us a message now to get started!
A google place to start might be pictures of before and after work, or pictures of happy customers, and a brief explanation of your process. You want people to very clearly understand how they can work with you and take the next step. Direct them to fill out a form, or give you a call. To take it to the next level, use our ‘Winning Website Formula’ – it’s primarily 5 key points: 1. Trust factors like testimonials and badges. 2. Clear visual call-to-actions. 3. Persuasive images and headlines demonstrating why you’re different. 4. SEO consideration throughout the process (make sure you have 500+ words on every page, and pages for every service you offer.) 5. Really clear differentiating features (what can your competitor NOT SAY.)
You can create one yourself on Weebly, Wix, Webs, Squarespace, or Godaddy website builder. You can pay for a cheaper web designer 2-10k to make you one on WordPress (usually via a pre-built template that other people might have as well,) or you can have a professional team like Hook Agency handle the process for you and create something persuasive and custom that fits your company like a glove. Many times people will go the cheap route one or two times before coming to us, or a company like ours. We are the ONLY high-end company that only works with , and actually does relentless and consistent SEO. 
If you have sold for the company – it will be way easier. Just type out the common questions people have (How do you price, how long does it take, what is your process?) and then clearly and concisely answer all of those questions, and mix in real images of work, and happy customers. The best content is written IN-HOUSE at a company, because you have the most intimate knowledge of your customers pain-points and how you help solve them. Lead with the PROBLEM, and why YOU’RE DIFFERENT, and a SIMPLE PROCESS. 
You have to either (A.) Pay for ads on Facebook and Google. (B) Push content out on the website, and slowly but surely work on your sites ‘Search Engine Optimization’ to get you higher on Google. Hook’s specialty is where Visual Design and SEO Combine to make a more effective website, we can also help you drive traffic with paid ads as well. 
These are just a great place to start – of course, you’ll want to have your site custom made from scratch to accentuate what makes your company special. Let us know if we can help design something you’re proud of!

  *   *   * 

Have you ever felt frustrated searching for answers on Google and not finding what you’re looking for? Believe it or not, that’s not what Google wants! Google aims to provide relevant ads and search results for its users. In order to keep users from having a bad experience, Google offers advertisers ad extensions to help businesses create relevant ad campaigns for users. As specialists, we have noticed that some of these extensions are incredibly helpful to use when running ads for .
Roofing have many options for getting leads, but when it comes to high quality, qualified leads, Google is best. For fast leads, Google Ads is a great option. The only problem is knowing how to get good leads and a solid ROI with Google Ads, how do you get results? 
Before you pull your hair out, let me give you a quick tip: Google’s primary focus is intent. When setting up Google ads, you need to keep this in mind. One thing you can do to improve your intent and, in turn, your account performance is create extensions relating to your roofing service(s). Creating ad extensions is a great way to match intent and improve campaign performance.

Ad Extensions allow advertisers to add extra information to their PPC ads. It gives your ads some extra flair and because it provides more information, customers typically have more options to pick from your services. This increases your chance of converting that prospect. 
: if you were to run ads on roofing repair, Google ads allow you to add additional services like gutter restoration or any other services you offer as an extension of that ad campaign. 
At Hook Agency we love using ads extensions for our roofing clients because we have noticed that it increases campaign performance. Here are the top three ad extensions we recommend for all roofers.
Call ad extensions allow you to add and display your phone number to your Google advertising campaigns. It gives your ads extra flair and improves the click through rate.
**Why are call extensions one of the best PPC ad extensions for roofing contractors?**
On average, we notice 30 or more additional clicks each month from call ad extensions alone for our roofing clients. In addition, Google will assign you a custom phone number when you enable the call metrics but reroute the call to your phone. We like this option because it allows you to track your results. 
Call ad extensions work great for just about any campaign, but you are likely to get the best result using call ad extensions when it comes to local services. Any roofing company would benefit from adding call extensions to their PPC advertising. As experts that have helped many roofing businesses, we recommend adding this extension to your ad campaigns.
Sitelink extensions are extremely effective! They allow you to create links to other related services below your ad. With sitelink extensions, you can promote multiple services that relate to the service you are creating the advertisement for. We recommend linking pages that closely relate to the page for which you are writing the advertisement.
Once you start using sitelink extensions, you’ll notice that a significant amount of your ad campaign traffic comes from them. Sitelink extensions are known for helping with an increase in CTR (click through rate). If you saw a diamond in the street, you probably would pick it up. Sitelinks extensions are your chance to do so. Use it to increase the number of calls and conversions your ad campaign receives.
Sitelink extensions are one of the best PPC ad extensions for roofing contractors, if you want to get a boost in your monthly leads, try them out! 
Image extensions allow you to add rich images that compliment your text ads. There is not a lot of information on this extension as it is pretty new. We have been using image extensions and have seen a lot of clicks directly from them. Image extensions are one of the best extensions because they complement your ads very nicely. If pictures are worth a thousand words, image extensions are worth a thousand clicks. If you are looking to boost your CTR and traffic, try image extensions. 
  1. Sign in, then head to the campaign or ad group you wish to create the extension
  2. There will be a blue plus button that can be click

Adding these extensions to your campaign will boost your performance and get you more qualified leads. If you need professional and knowledgeable Google Adwords management, call

  *   *   * 

website inspiration is a little harder to come by on average, as a lot of websites look out-dated.
  * Maybe you don’t think that your plumbing website has to be cutting-edge.
  * Perhaps your competitor’s sites look way more unprofessional than yours.
  * Maybe you’re already successful and you don’t see what value a custom website might have.
  * We create gorgeous plumbing websites and offer to help plumbers get higher on Google.


We decided to curate 5 awesome plumbing of companies who invested in their websites, leading to better and more high-quality leads.
We’ll give you what we like and what we don’t like about each example, and then share 5 keys to making sure your plumbing website is as likely to convert website visitors into leads as possible, below the examples.
Each of these exemplifies something we strongly suggest for people trying to get more leads on their plumbing website!
We collaborated very closely with this company ensuring everything they dreamed of having on their website was incoporated – and as you can see we came up with this powerful, and highly focused and plumbing website design:
  * Reviews right up top in a way that feels widgetized and authentic.
  * “Key differentiating features” such as same-day service and installation guaranteed, Lifetime Guarantee, and Financing and Quick approvals. 
  * A big ‘Book Appointment’ button right away, and on every page in the header


We love this site because it showcases family-centered imagery and a lead form right away, while icons showcase key differentiating features of the plumbing company. 
**More importantly than the beautiful plumbing website design – is the 10x increase in keywords and traffic 6 months into working with Thelen Mechanical.**
What’s working well: We completely overhauled the look of this website, bringing it into the 2020’s, and giving it a look that better reflects the quality of the companies services. 
> “What a wonderful experience working with everyone on the Hook team! Everyone is very engaged and focused in making our web site and project successful. Its been 6 months and the results we are getting are phenomenal! So much that we just engaged with Hook to build and develop another web site for us. Awesome experience!” 
> – A Google Review from 4Front Energy (Paladdin’s parent company)
Right away we have the trust factors – in the ratings right next to the form. The form is up top, and ‘Request service is emphasized.’ Key bullet points are easy to read, and getting started is quick and easy. (If you need a plumbing website – build by professionals, .)
> “Hook Agency is a great company to work with. Easy to deal with and very good at what they do. They increased our web traffic substantially and got our phones ringing. I highly recommend this company.”
The smiling faces, easy to get started call-to-action, and the 4 main services all clear and right away – complements the modern, fresh – full-width design.
‘There’s a reason they call us Mr.’ has to be one of the weirder / more vague taglines I’ve seen in quite a long time. A good reminder that the MESSAGING on your site is just as It needs to be persuasive and clear. “If you confuse, you lose.”
What simplicity does is make the things that ARE there stand out more, that’s why you don’t want a website that feels ‘cluttered.’
The problem here is that the design is so simple that there might be a few more things visitors would need before making a request. Trade organizations, a clear phone number, pictures of the team, sub-services and process for instance.
The brand here is strong – and gives a very pleasant ‘vintage feel.’ Yes, Williams does a lot more than just plumbing, but the design is simple enough. and the site laid out well enough – it doesn’t overwhelm you.
There are a couple of very boring sections on this site – where they’ve just crammed in a bunch of text. The reason for this is to give Google a way to know what the services they offer are (text is good for ) but there are a lot of ways that a plumbing website can do this without it feeling just like a huge chunk of text on the site, like alternating images on the left and right at least.
The number right away, the easy search and the quick bullet points of the process are all super useful for the average homeowner just looking to get quick service.
We really like big smiling faces, and something that indicates the service right away in an image. In this case the photo is heavily overlayed, but honestly – this whole site is very well done.
The feels a little heavy and not particularly trustworthy – I’m not sure you want brown as the main color if you’re a plumber.
Having a beautiful plumbing website might not be enough to really drive new sales.
Certainly you want to have the basics in place, here’s 3 I suggest on every website:
  * A reviews carousel, with who left the review and the logo of where it was left, with a 5-star icon.
  * At least 500 words on each selling page so search engines have context, and people can get the important information they need.
  * Headlines and images that are focused on happy customers, and how the company helps solve their problem (not focused on how cool the company is.)


Great photos – ideally means they are original photos, but that takes time and effort to get, so if nothing else, make sure the photos aren’t cheesy old stock photos, make sure they feel modern and not of a too-clean or ‘overused’ style.
I strongly suggest working with a professional on a custom website design, and my favorite platform is WordPress, because it’s best in class for , and it’s open source so people are always creating new add-on’s for it that are great for marketing.
That being said – it’s hard getting started on that, so if you are going to make it yourself, I might suggest:
  1. – clean templates, spacious and sparse. Perhaps start with the .
  2. – ton’s of options. Perhaps start with the from Roomy Themes.
  3. – Older design / look – but there are plumber options like the Plumber .


If you can find someone to help, or you’re willing to put in 20 hours learning the basics of using a WordPress template or theme – here are 5 WordPress themes for plumbers to consider:


But Tim – why are you sharing all these cheap WordPress themes for plumbers?
Aren’t you scared that will make people not want to buy your custom website services?
  * Our best customers have tried templated websites before and decided they wanted to go the professional route by the time they get to us.
  * If your website could mean the difference between a slow season and your phone ringing off the hook, it makes sense to spend more. Totally possible – when we do Search Engine Optimization for clients, just look at what Jim Alberts of AJ Alberts Plumbing said about our services:


We handle blogging and landing page writing for Plumbing companies, but we don’t suggest having an outside company write your main selling pages, and the about pages on your website – why?
  * You should actually put your personality into your main page content.
  * Focus on your best customers and write a ‘sales letter’ to them, pretend like you’re talking to one customer.
  * Share examples of happy customers, and boil the main BENEFITS into headlines and bullet points so people can skim.
  * But certainly – try to make sure that each key page has at least 500 words on it for Search Engine Optimization purposes.


If you do decide to work with a professional plumbing website design company – make sure they have a lot of great 5-star reviews!
We work with a lot of trade / companies and have 50+ five-star reviews on Google.
If you are looking for a company that will listen to you – and create a modern, search engine friendly website design for your plumbing company, send us a message now to get started!
A google place to start might be pictures of before and after work, or pictures of happy customers, and a brief explanation of your process. You want people to very clearly understand how they can work with you and take the next step. Direct them to fill out a form, or give you a call. To take it to the next level, use our ‘Winning Website Formula’ – it’s primarily 5 key points: 1. Trust factors like testimonials and badges. 2. Clear visual call-to-actions. 3. Persuasive images and headlines demonstrating why you’re different. 4. SEO consideration throughout the process (make sure you have 500+ words on every page, and pages for every service you offer.) 5. Really clear differentiating features (what can your competitor NOT SAY.)
You can create one yourself on Weebly, Wix, Webs, Squarespace, or Godaddy website builder. You can pay for a cheaper web designer 2-10k to make you one on WordPress (usually via a pre-built template that other people might have as well,) or you can have a professional team like Hook Agency handle the process for you and create something persuasive and custom that fits your company like a glove. Many times people will go the cheap route one or two times before coming to us, or a company like ours. We are the ONLY high-end company that only works with , and actually does relentless and consistent SEO. 
If you have sold for the company – it will be way easier. Just type out the common questions people have (How do you price, how long does it take, what is your process?) and then clearly and concisely answer all of those questions, and mix in real images of work, and happy customers. The best content is written IN-HOUSE at a company, because you have the most intimate knowledge of your customers pain-points and how you help solve them. Lead with the PROBLEM, and why YOU’RE DIFFERENT, and a SIMPLE PROCESS. 
You have to either (A.) Pay for ads on Facebook and Google. (B) Push content out on the website, and slowly but surely work on your sites ‘Search Engine Optimization’ to get you higher on Google. Hook’s specialty is where Visual Design and SEO Combine to make a more effective website, we can also help you drive traffic with paid ads as well. 
These are just a great place to start – of course, you’ll want to have your site custom made from scratch to accentuate what makes your company special. Let us know if we can help design something you’re proud of!

  *   *   * 

Not too long ago, there were not as many options out there — and some of the options that did exist were ultimately very bad. For instance:
  * They wouldn’t give you access to your website or own all the content.
  * “Marketing companies” would sell you leads but not help build your systems to get those leads. 
  * Avoid agencies that do these 3 things – none of our top 7 agencies do these things: 


I know what you’re thinking: “Tim, don’t you have your own marketing agency? Are you just going to shill for your company?” Let’s address that right off the bat.
Yes, I run where we specialize in , , and websites, and we’re really good at what we do. But here’s the thing, having an abundance mindset in business means acknowledging and showcasing others who are also doing great work.
Before we dive in, a quick caveat: every marketing agency has its ups and downs. Some people have had bad experiences with every agency out there, so I’m not 100% endorsing any of these. Check them out thoroughly and see which one might meet your needs.
If you have any deeper questions – please don’t hesitate to reach out. **You might find it useful to contact some of the highly-rated marketing companies in this article,** such as , Roofer Marketers, and Ascend Digital Agency, and ask for their client success stories or case studies. These documents often include details about the number of leads generated or the return on investment (ROI) for their clients, which can give you a sense of their success rates.
You can also ask them for references or testimonials from current or past clients. Speaking directly with these clients can provide firsthand insights into the effectiveness of a company’s services.
In general, these marketing companies below are better than that. Although we are a as well, we often get asked, “Who else would you suggest if we don’t go with you?” and these companies are our go-tos:
First on our list is . They are highly specialized in Google Ads, catering to various industries including roofing, hardscaping, and more.


We’ve heard fantastic things about their work and have seen some impressive results. So, if Google Ads are a crucial part of your strategy, this agency could be a great fit.
From what I understand, Webrunner media is very good with Google ads for roofing and has solid reporting and systems for making sure you know what you need to do in between meetings. We’ve had overlapping clients and they produced a solid amount of leads and do nice landing pages when appropriate if you need them.
**Here are a few reviews that explain why people like working with them:**
**Here is their rating on Google Business Profile as of this post:**
Next up is . The person to know here is Michael Sterns. He’s highly recommended in various Facebook marketing groups, and I’ve seen the behind-the-scenes work on his projects.


Their websites look great, and more importantly, the work they do results in noticeable traffic and keyword ranking increases. This often correlates directly to more leads for your business.
Michael Stearns and Ascend Digital Agency have a ton of people in the Roofing Facebook groups vouching for them, and swearing by the lead flow. They can help you set up your Google ads and allow for a ‘paid discovery’ before buying something bigger. Michael is very communicative, according to reviews, and gets the leads he promises.
is a partner of ours and handles print marketing exceptionally well. They offer services like yard signs and direct mail, which are essential for roofing businesses.


Their approach integrates with your CRM to automate the sending of marketing materials, making it easier to manage large volumes.
Direct mail and so much more – Dope Marketing stands for ‘Data on Previous Engagement.’ They have the ability to automatically send direct mail to areas where a job sells automatically. They connect with nearly every roofing CRM. They do hand-written notes at scale with an auto-writer and so much more. 
Not to mention yard signs, Christmas cards for your customers, and tons of traditional print stuff. 
is more of a training company than a traditional marketing agency, but they’re incredibly well-regarded in the industry for their training programs.


They provide comprehensive training that can significantly enhance your in-house marketing capabilities. Clients who’ve gone through their programs often see remarkable improvements in their campaigns.
Contractor Dynamics is more of a marketing training agency with videos and weekly workshops, as well as workshops for your team. Joseph Hughes is a respected voice in the roofing space, speaks at events, and has deep expertise in Facebook ad training, in particular. 
Out of Atlanta, offers a blend of affordable coaching and courses, along with services for video content, websites, and ongoing marketing efforts.


Bruce and his team are committed to doing right by their clients, and they have a strong reputation in the industry.
Though not a traditional agency, offers unique solutions for increasing leads through referrals from insurance agents.


Their system involves providing value to insurance agents and creating a reciprocal referral network, which can significantly boost your referral leads.
Matt Danskin is in a league of his own as far as roofing marketing goes – almost un-categorizable, but we’ll try. His system involves turning insurance agents into referral partners. They also have a software, but the core value here is the intellectual property and his ability to train your team and turn them into a squad of referral generating bad-asses. 
Lastly, we have to mention , based in Minneapolis. We are a team of 30 with a strong focus on the roofing industry, and we pride ourselves on our transparency and customer service.


> “We are kind of open. We’re open that we’ll recommend competitors. We’re open with all of our secrets.” – Tim, Hook Agency
[Get a 10 Minute Demo of Our Services + What a Report Looks Like](https://hookagency.com/demo/)
We’re known for being highly transparent with our deliverables and sharing a lot of our knowledge freely through platforms like . We care deeply about our clients and strive to provide exceptional customer service.
So there you have it, folks. These are the top seven roofing marketing agencies to consider for 2024. Each of these has its strengths, so make sure to vet them thoroughly to see which one aligns best with your company.


A lot of the people selling at marketing agencies have never actually done the work. 
This makes it confusing when they talk about the work being done.
Ideally, you’d get a better experience by asking to talk to people who are doing the work. (this is why our salesperson came from doing Google ads before this job.)
There are very large players in the roofing marketing agency space that don’t let you own your website, and I find that very sad.
  * They have their own proprietary system they build the website, and when you leave, no one else can work on it.
  * You pay monthly, but when you leave – they would take your website down.
  * Basically, it comes down to, when you leave – people do weird stuff, and frankly, we believe that’s not right. 


We’ve seen companies like these burn a lot of clients. It’s hard to be a specialist when you do 100 things, and you often bite off more than you can chew.
Choose someone who’s specialized in marketing and ideally specializes in a particular type of marketing so you know they’re experts.
With all these amazing roofing marketing agencies – why would you go with some shlub you find at your BNI group?
Because you can give him a painfully hard handshake when he fails to deliver?
I hope you’re doing your hand exercises because it gets tiring explaining the same roofing basics repeatedly so they don’t embarrass you online. 
I’m not trying to say you should never try the cheap route…
But ‘fool me once, shame on me,’ and ‘fool me twice…’
“Hire the cheap agency over and over again,” and don’t be confused when they don’t deliver consistent leads.
  * Choose someone you can feel a rapport with and will push to hit your marketing goals. 
  * Choose someone with expertise in roofing marketing, in general – because there are a ton of efficiencies after you’ve done this 10+ times.
  * Choose someone who cares about their long-term reputation in the market and would be remiss to mess it up by doing poor work.


Best of luck finding the best roofer marketers for your needs! 
I appreciate you taking the time to read this. If you’ve had experiences with any of these agencies or have other recommendations, feel free to let me know. I’m always keen to hear your thoughts and experiences.
To market a roofing business well, you must employ many similar techniques that other small businesses use. Paid advertisement is always a good place to start. Google pay-per-click or Google local service ads can both increase the number of sales your roofing business is doing. With the help of a good marketing agency, you can create content optimized for the Google search. Your ranking in the Google search engine will determine how many people can see your website and the roofing services you offer. If you’ve already created content but haven’t optimized it, an agency can help rebuild your content using keywords and popular search terms in your area. Content optimization is the number one marketing tool small businesses rely on as it brings in more organic sales from customers. On your business website, make sure to share previous positive customer reviews.
Roofers get clients by using the marketing tools on offer, like many other small businesses. Roofing installation and repair is a service that has been around for a long time and will always be necessary, unlike some industries. For that reason, some older forms of marketing still work. For example, while long letters in the mail probably won’t bring in many new clients, pamphlets with a short explanation of your roofing services and contact information delivered to homes in the area will realistically still work. This detail is especially true if you live in a residential or commercial building area. Since roofing is a business done on clients’ properties, having content sent directly to them in the mail is still a practical form of marketing. However, it’s still a smart practice to create a high-quality website and social media presence for your clients to see when they want to look you up.
To increase your roof sales, ensure your website is ranked very high. Most consumers choose a business in the top 3-5 bars of Google search, so work with an agency or marketing professional to ensure your content is as optimized as possible. If you’ve seen several months go by without an uptick in sales or with no new customers, your business isn’t showing up when people look for roofers in your area. If changing your ranking isn’t enough, paid marketing on Google or social media sites in your area may be a strategic move for your business. Finally, look into the area where you’re trying to find clients. Try to get a good idea about whether or not people in the area are looking for roofing services and if you can specialize your services to solve an ongoing problem, a client may have had.
Roofers get leads through promotional marketing, just like other companies that offer . Paid advertising, optimized content creation for your website and social media pages, and presenting with a positive reputation and case studies from satisfied clients can all help roofers get leads. Roofers can get leads more specific to their profession in a few ways. Whether or not they’re working in a commercial area, roofers may contact and collaborate with brokers who can provide them with prospective client information, generating leads that way. Roofers may also work with realtors or attend roofing trade shows. Trade shows can be a great place to generate leads and find collaborative solutions with other roofers and industry professionals. While it’s less common, roofers may go door to door to generate leads. The most cost-effective and quickest way to get leads as a roofer is to work with a talented marketing professional.
It can cost anywhere between 15 and 500 dollars to buy a roofing lead. The price hinges on where you get it and if it’s exclusive or shared. How much a roofer wants to pay for a lead depends on the total cost of the job and how much profit the roofer will make. As a roofer, you may pay for leads from other , third-party brokers, or shared lead outlets online or otherwise. A shared lead will always be less lucrative than an exclusive lead because the roofer will be competing against other for the job. The best way to generate organic, exclusive leads is to have a professional and easy-to-access online presence. If a prospect can find the website and look at the roofing services easily through Google search, the roofer is generating exclusive leads through their site. Ideal scenario: a marketing agency can build you a professional website – and you attract those leads yourself so that you own every lead that comes in and the systems that create more leads.

The world has been shaken up, old tactics are getting less effective.
The pounding doors people are still loud, but less confident.
– if you don’t OWN DIGITAL, then you’re possibly missing out on a huge treasure trove of leads that you just won’t get through door-knocking.
– in fact, that’s our number 1 top lead gen tactic for companies, still in 2024. Check out the other top activities, ranked here in this video:
### **3Big Updates to The Roofing Leads Guide for 2024: Tools, Short Form Video, Digital Door-knocking**
The digital evolution isn’t stopping, and neither should you. Being on the frontline means being online. Here’s what’s ringing the bell in the tech department for roofers:
  * Think about this – a tool that tells you who, what, where, and when. No more missed calls, no more lost leads. It’s the digital age’s answer to a front desk receptionist, and it doesn’t take lunch breaks. (Three top CRM’s in roofing are Acculynx, JobNimbus and Rooflink – but an up-and-comer in roofing is ServiceTitan) 
  * It’s past midnight, someone’s roof is playing peekaboo with the rain, and you’re… asleep? No worries. Let AI handle the SOS calls and lead them right into your capable hands the next morning. (Air is a customer service / A.I. call answering service as well)
  * Yes, texting. Not the “You’ve won a million dollars!” type. Texts that resonate, build trust, and, best of all, lead to contracts. A little “ping” on the phone can indeed lead to a big “ka-ching” in the bank.

A picture is worth a thousand words, but a video? That’s a whole novel. In the sea of content, only the most visually arresting will capture attention. Here’s where to cast your net:
  * Showcasing a start-to-finish project? Pure gold. It’s like binge-watching for roof lovers. Let clients see the magic unfold, one frame at a time.

This is a story – a story of a bad-ass roofing business owner. He started with . At the time of this video, he was over for that year.
  1. Pushing into BRAND, and trying to make your brand and company reputation strong in the community.
  2. Building out your online presence. With social media, website, Google My Business + reviews, etc.
  3. Content marketing, publishing on your website and landing pages for niches + cities.
  4. buying the top money-making keywords, ‘near me’ searches, etc.
  5. Writing persuasive ad copy, making videos for Facebook ads, geo-targeting those ads, and making concise offers.
  6. Getting higher in the main area of Google with content, links, and technical changes to your website.
  7. Google Local Services (Google Guaranteed,) and getting a ton of reviews. Google Local Services is the #1 top tip I give to roofers trying to increase leads if they aren’t there yet.
  8. Experimented with Thumbtack, Angie’s List, Porch, and Telemarketing. If you aren’t trying new things and doing a ‘full court press’, and trying everything possible (including door-knocking at least when a storm hits) perhaps try it.
  9. Referrals can be amazing – consider pushing into being a subject matter expert on social media, in a way that would help remind your friends and current customers to refer you.


If you came to this guide trying to ‘buy roofing leads’, or looking for some kind of quick fix – please listen:
  * Outsourcing the entire strategy of your lead generation 
  * Because many of these types of schemes, leave way too much power in the hands of the folks you’ve outsourced to, and in many cases either were ‘scammy’ to begin with or basically end up feeling like a scam.
  * That’s why OWNING your marketing and all the assets to your marketing is the best way to go about growing your business and lead flow.


#### **2 Quick Examples of BAD DEALS in roofing lead generation**
  * your ‘roofing lead provider’ owns the website for ‘Your City + Roofing’ – they say it’s to get quick results, but after 2 years of buying the leads from them, they take the show on the road, with , left with nothing.
  * You’re basically renting your website, it’s just $600 dollars a month, they build everything, etc, but then when you try to discontinue the contract, you own nothing. The website’s not yours, the content they wrote isn’t yours, and all you are left with is a blank domain, once the contract is up. Ouch!


  1. Help guide you along the way, and be an advisor on the right types of activities and assets to create.
  2. Everything they make, including the website and content, should be YOURS, that you can keep forever, whether or not you keep paying them.


  * How many leads are you getting in an average month?
  * How many ‘qualified leads’ are you getting an average month?
  * Ideally, you also know what ‘lead sources’ have the best closing ratio.


If you’re early – recognize you obviously need to ‘full court press’ and try all of the best roofing lead generation tactics that exist, but also, your absolute best methods will be the ones that are long, hard, and slow.
  * means being out in the community with trucks, signs, referral partnerships, and trade shows.


  * means treating every customer like their 5-star review is the key to the next job.
  * means making it easy for them to tell their neighbor about how easy, and ideally delightful (food gift at the end of the job, perhaps?)

Whether that be with us or other legitimate roofing lead generation + marketing agencies. (Hint: look at their Google reviews ‍ )
  1. – Great reputation with contractors, best if you or someone in your company has time and aptitude to learn Facebook advertising, and you have a budget to push into it.
  2. – focused exclusively on paid ads for contractors. We have clients using them for paid ads and us for SEO, we have a great relationship with them, and highly recommend them.
  3. – We push on lead generation websites for contractors, and heavy-duty SEO (we apply a lot of effort) through content marketing, link-building, and technical changes to your website in an ongoing way. **Here’s a pic of me up on a roof with Josh Swisher, learning the basics (and being a good shingle jockey )**


Some people decide to get a marketing manager at 5 Million, and some people might later – but the point is, as a growth-oriented roofing company, it’s hard to have specialists in all of the right roofing lead generation tactics.
  * – certainly if you’re going hard on this you could have an employee, but it will make sense for many to have a local video contractor that comes in once or twice a month to batch videos together.
  * – Getting the basics down is easy, gaining mastery, and really getting powerful ROI could take an outside expert – consider how heavily you’re doing this. Spending more than 5k, for sure you should have a professional running this.


  * – needs to be persuasive, and high-end to get the most leads. If it’s at 80% awesome, and you don’t have 500+ people on your website a month, the website design might not be the problem though. You need to find ways to get more people to the website regularly – and that’s hard!


  * – We know roofing SEO can be hard and time-consuming. If you need a specialist here, Hook Agency is the best SEO company for roofing contractors.

**Read on for a super in-depth version of what you’ve read already + rating different lead sources one by one.**
**Are you getting roofing leads constantly? Do you want to put the processes and systems in place to get roofing leads regularly?**
It’s not quick – and it’s not easy – but it’s worth doing. We’ve rated them by several criteria – how big the opportunity to get leads is, how quick they are to take effect, and how long it takes before the effect wears off. Building a reputable brand isn’t on the list – but the opportunity there for leads is HUGE (5/5), it does not take effect quickly (1/5), but if you have a great brand and reputation it will give you returns for a long time into the future. (5/5)
From pounding the pavement and knocking on doors, to paid ads and Search Engine Optimization. We surveyed some of the top roofing companies and are sharing with you the strategies for building your roofing business beyond your wildest imagination. It starts with what? That’s right – leads.
(Then of course you have to be able to close the business – but that’s how you got here, right?)
**When you first open your roofing business, the rush of new leads may give you false hope that you’ll easily find leads consistently.** But, finding new roofing leads is something that you need to work on continuously as part of your overall marketing strategy. As a roofing business owner, you should have some creative ideas in your pocket to use to help you generate new leads as your business grows. The following methods are reliable enough to bring you some leads that you can convert to sales but creative enough to excite people about your company.
Many roofing business owners got their start pounding the pavement – they recognized that although uncomfortable sometimes, there is insane amounts of opportunity just getting out and having conversations with people that have been affected by storms. Once you get the rush of selling someone face to face and realize that the money is literally falling from the sky – you may get addicted to it. The only harsh reality here is that there isn’t always a storm – so that means the general need for roofing services is usually spread farther and wide than just canvassing a specific city.
Door knocking is a massive and undeniable opportunity in the arsenal of roofing companies to get more leads (and close more deals), but it most definitely should not be the only one.
You know that your site is an essential part of your marketing strategy. But, you may not know how important it is for your site to stand out from the competition and be ready to convert visitors to leads and, potentially, to customers. Therefore, your should be creative, engaging, and optimized to pull visitors in to make it one of the best ways to find free roofing leads that come to you.
How do you do that? An essential element of your website that shows visitors the most important aspects of your company is the landing page. This is the main page that visitors see when they visit your site and can list everything from your services and photo gallery to your contact information and links for a free quote. The less amount of time people clicks around to find out what they came to your site for, the more likely they’ll be to fill out a quick contact form or give their information for you to communicate with them.
Your landing page should be clean with precise wording, engaging , and crisp photos. Stick to making it simple instead of overloading it with information. Your visitors should be able to skim it to find what they need. Include a clear call-to-action to entice visitors to give you their email address or fill out a form for a free quote, giving you a lead with no additional effort from you.

Google paid search ads, or campaigns can be gigantically successful – depending on how much competition there is in the area, the amount of serious need – and of course your ability and making effective ads. There can be a lot of waste if you’re not setting up your ads correctly, and to some degree, it requires experimentation and pivoting those experiments based on the feedback (the effectiveness) of those ads out in the wild.
But Google Paid ads can be an extremely viable way to generate more leads for your roofing company. Just like canvassing, it shouldn’t be used alone, of course. Ideally, you mix and match 3 or 4 of the top methods for getting roofing leads so that you can diversify lead sources, and not depend on one.
> “Google Local Services ads should be part of any roofer marketing plan. These are a newer Google Ad format that is widely available to roofers, but many are not using them despite the numerous advantages they offer. First, they appear at the absolute top of Google search results. Second, they note that companies are “Google Guaranteed” and show off star ratings and reviews. Lastly, and best of all, they are a pay per call model and reasonably priced. Qualified calls average less than $50 each and Google does not charge for hang-ups or wrong numbers. This is particularly advantageous for roofers with a weak web presence or outdate website, because it allows them to advertise with Google and generate leads without ever sending people to their site.” – 
> “A simple way to get more is to use landing pages for all of your marketing campaigns. While full-blown websites are great for allowing visitors to gather information, they stink at turning them into new leads for your business. Relevant messaging is the key to getting someone to give you their contact information, and by using landing pages, you’re able to focus your message around what got someone there in the first place, while eliminating all other irrelevant information. This leads to higher conversion rates, an increased volume of leads, and a lower cost per lead. Plus, using landing pages allows you to test various page elements against each other much faster and simpler than you ever could on a website, which allows for continuous improvement over time. Conversion-focused landing pages are a must if you plan on using paid ads to grow your business.” 
When you partner with local businesses, you show your support of your local commerce system and get your company name spread to others who may need your services at some point. A roofing company may find it beneficial to target local hardware stores, for example, to find people who may be interested in their business. This type of partnership is also called co-marketing.
Many co-marketing partnerships work well with using referrals. The hardware store may refer a customer who’s looking to repair his roof on his own to your company and offer one of your business cards. In return, you can refer your clients to the same hardware store for supplies they need to maintain their homes. You’ll get free advertisement by partnering with local businesses and the additional advantage of a trustworthy business backing your company name.
A referral program for your employees and customers can also help generate roofing leads for your business. Your employees want to remain in business as much as you do, so offering incentives for them to refer friends and family to your company for their roofing needs may encourage them to share with others about your business’s services consistently.
And your clients can be one of the best resources for giving you free roofing leads. Happy customers are often willing to share their experiences with others on social media or review sites. Offer a special discount for future service to any client who brings you a qualified lead.
Weather is an important part of the roofing business, so why not use it to your advantage to generate more leads? There are several storm-tracking apps and software that you can use to stay on top of where weather experts expect storms to hit in your area, or you can subscribe to weather alerts through your local news stations or The Weather Channel.
Once you learn where and when the storms are coming, you can get your crew prepared and call or visit the homes or businesses of those likely to be affected. Some storm alerts can give you several days’ warning before one hits, so you may even have time to send out a direct mail campaign targeting the affected area.
If you have any charisma – or can take interesting photos, it pays to wield those assets on social media. Now roofing isn’t necessarily the ‘sexiest’ industry in all regards, but it can pay to be aware of what about it IS INTERESTING. If you can use a general sense of what you’d like to see if you were in need of a roof – or just a homeowner, what to watch out for, how to clean your gutters or do basic maintenance – then you can showcase those things in little how-to posts on social media, or ideally do little videos that give quick and useful tips to homeowners.
> “At Lasting Trend, we found that offering valuable insights and quick, useful tips on social can spark interest from users. You can have a Q&A session on Facebook Live, showcase before-and-after pictures and answer users’ questions on other pages (for example, the ones about home improvements). In this case, you promote your brand’s name without being too aggressive.” – Tim Absalikov Co-founder & CMO at 
Yes, this takes time and a bit of awareness of the particular platforms – but I would suggest sticking to 2 or so that you can do really well, then trying to master everyone and god forbid, end up on Snapchat trying to sell roofs to 17-year-old
Be careful with direct mail because you can waste your money on it if you don’t do it right. The above example is a piece that could really get someone’s attention – but always remember: it’s not about you – it’s about them. You need something that makes that want – no – to get in contact with you. You have to stoke DESIRE – so that if they need a roof, they might as well contact you. Don’t make your logo the biggest thing, and don’t try to sell every single one of your services – speak to THEIR pain point for ONE THING.
Make sure you use a very tight list based on your ideal customers. Make sure you include a very intense and obvious call to action – Call 555-555-5555 right now or go to ourwebsite.com. It’s not their fault if you’re copywriting is too vague. Spell it out, and make it easy for them.
> “Direct marketing offers Roofing Companies who want to increase their business the most cost-effective way to locate their absolute best prospects. Direct marketing refers to direct mail, telemarketing, email and social media marketing. These marketing channels give roofers entrée to the right people, offering tremendous visibility, which is key to branding and lead generation.
> Roofers should never spend their precious marketing dollars reaching out to people who aren’t solid prospects. Newspapers, ADVO, radio + TV don’t give you the bang for your buck. You need to reach out only to those Homeowners or Businesses in your specific market areas who are prime candidates for your roofing services.. For Roofers looking to generate new residential customers leads, we suggest finely targeted property owner data. These homeowner lists can be overlaid with home year built, roof type and modeled credit score. Those roofers who are looking for commercial prospects succeed with our commercial property file, which offers an option to select free standing business locations.
> The key to success is reaching these top prospects via multiple marketing channels. A great gives roofers the option to do this.” – 
Finding local leads is the most important part of a roofing business unless you don’t mind traveling a lot. Participating in trade shows and local events can give you an advantage over other companies in your area who choose not to get involved. Even if they do join, you can use the events to keep up on new things other companies are doing so you’ll know where you may need to improve.
Those visiting your trade show booth should get significant takeaways, like your contact information and something valuable, like a free quote. And be sure to get contact information for your leads so you can follow up with them. Also, check your local Chamber of Commerce for upcoming business events and ask how you can participate. A noted that 87% of people prefer to meet others in person, so face-to-face communication can be a great way to generate leads.
Promoted posts can be extremely useful just for brand awareness – they allow you to pay to have your regular Facebook posts show up higher on people’s regular newsfeeds. Depending on your age and general level of social media activity it may need to be said but, there is a ridiculous amount of attention spent (maybe you think wasted) on Social media today, and no more than Facebook (Twitter + Instagram combined don’t equal the amount of time spent on Facebook).
By taking some of that attention – and paying for it, you can be ahead of many roofers still paying for Google ads only. But it really depends on your area, just like how good of a deal you can get on Google paid ads depends on your area. Want to own two or three mid-size first-ring suburbs? It can pay to spend solid amount of advertising dollars on Facebook if you use it’s extremely useful targeting tools. I can’t help but favor Google ads and SEO if I had to choose just two because it’s hard to interrupt people with this service when so many people have a specific time they are looking for it and you might as well get them while they’re searching. That being said I would still inundate ‘homeowners’ in storm-effected areas with Facebook ads.
> “One of the best ways to generate roofing leads today is to use video ads on Facebook. A video is a powerful form of communication that can help position your roofing company to be perceived as a roofing expert vs. a roofing salesman. If you have a video that provides valuable information that can help a homeowner make a better decision on securing their home it will not only help you generate more leads it will help you generate a higher-quality lead.” – 
Paid ads can also help your salespeople do their groundwork, and if clients have seen you online already before a sales pitch is brought to them, that can assist the sales team in capturing that lead.
You know them I’m sure because they spam the hell out of roofers (and many service providers actually,) but it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at least add yourself to their platform. It’s still worth it to EXIST on them – but you have to be strong and not cave to their aggressive salesmanship. I’ve heard of people spending 23k to be featured on Houzz for a year and getting exactly 0 leads.
Call me old-fashioned but I don’t think you should spend 23k for no leads.
may be appropriate for some if absolutely necessary, but the problem is you may be inundated with expensive leads that are already picked over, and that have absolutely no awareness of your brand or allegiance whatsoever.
I think roofers should run their own experiments and try every possible opportunity for leads before settling on to 3-4 ways to get leads that work for them – but in general, I doubt that those consistent, on-fire leads you’re looking for aren’t going to come from some parasitic website like the ones above that sometimes literally rank for your own name above you, and then sell the lead back to you. Lame.
Radio ads can be great if you’re local and the time is right. But really radio is another tool to add to your arsenal to try to be the #1 top-of-mind roofing company in the area. That is – have better ‘brand awareness’ than your competitors.
Focus on creating an ad that seriously catches people’s attention. Once again (like the mailers), focus on the customer’s pain point – how can you help them fix THAT pain point? Can you make that into a powerful headline to start the ad?
Make sure to include a call-to-action and a specific reason to contact you like a FREE report, or a FREE inspection.
Extra Credit: Make sure the ad has a cut-off – “Call now to get our til the end of “. Having a cutoff point creates urgency in people’s minds that there’s a reason to call or go to the website and get the resource now, rather than waiting till next week.
Telemarketing is all about timing as well. It all comes back to timing your calls around weather events. If you can get your people on the phones, or hire a telemarketing company to get on the phones quickly and aggressively – there’s an opportunity that expires as soon as they have someone come up to their door, or they choose to use the roofing company with a sign in their neighbor’s yard.
If you want to get more leads from Google – you need to be thinking beyond the traditional on-site search engine optimization of 10 years ago. When we optimize websites, we’re thinking about local directory listings, and especially about how the business is showing up in Google maps. We’ve even found a couple of tricks to really push up visibility in this area of the search results – one example, for instance, is that you need to push to get more Google reviews as they actually play a part in visibility here.
– as I mentioned above Google rating matters, but if you can get great reviews on Facebook and Yelp – the likelihood of people contacting you goes up.
– If you are building an e-mail list, putting your best content and promotions in front of them regularly (without being annoying) is great for brand awareness – and occasionally leads, depending on the size of your list.
– Having a professional website pays off, but you also need to focus on how easy it is for people to contact you and building out useful resources that also lead to conversions (or contact forms and phone calls.) If you are building a ton of SEO traffic or spending on – and not seeing as many results as would seem appropriate, circle back around on the website and add trust factors like reviews, photos of your team, and roofing jobs you’ve done, as well as call to actions and a compelling offer upfront.
– You should be creating long-term marketing systems that increase awareness of your brand and solidify it in the industry as being a good option. It is going to be much easier to close a deal if your potential client has seen your brand on trucks, signs, Facebook, Linkedin, etc. These long-term marketing tactics help support your salespeople as well as build your brand.
Help your sales team have the most resources they can have, the best sales pitches and plans, and a brand built that supports their sales. Help from the marketing team is key to making those sales. Work on making your brand the only option for your area to choose from, and that will help your salespeople close deals. Continuing education is key to supporting your sales team as well, as practicing sales pitches and routines to get the perfect one that works.
Put in the work to receive and maintain good Google reviews. You should crave feedback from customers, as it’s the best feedback you can get, right from the source. Maintaining a high star rating is super valuable because customers can see it as they’re researching your company.
A little bit of creativity in your website and marketing efforts can go a long way in generating leads for your roofing business. It’s important to get your company name into the hands of as many locals as possible, which is easier when you do so in a creative way that stands out. Be present in your town by partnering with other businesses and participating in events and leveraging your current clients and employees to reach potential leads.
There are literally hundreds of ways to get more roofing leads. But a few ways to get started include – wrapping your truck, using yard signs, getting a professional website, promoting your website with Google ads, and getting higher on Google with search engine optimization, Angie’s List, Thumbtack, Houzz, and Home Advisor. Ideally, you own your marketing systems – rather than ‘rent’ through a lead generation site like HomeAdvisor. Utilize as many lead generation systems as possible – then double down on the ones that worked, and remove the ones that don’t give a good return on investment.
Promoting a roofing company – you should start with the basics. u003ca href=u0022https://hookagency.com/roofing-company-names/u0022u003eName the company something originalu003c/au003e, have a graphic designer create a memorable brand and create a website and a Google My Business listing. Claim your page on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, as well as promote these pages to your personal network. From there, escalate your efforts to the truck wrap, yard signs, PPC, and SEO efforts. Creating systems to get more referrals, and leveraging social networks is the easiest way to start – while making video marketing, SEO, PPC, and event marketing are heavy-duty marketing and brand-building techniques.
It depends on who you ask – according to a survey, 23 percent of the roofing company owners said they made under $50,000 per year! A larger percentage of 40% of owners were earning $50,001 to $100,000 annually, u0026amp; 24 percent of roofing company owners were earning $100,001 to $200,000 annually. I was very surprised by these numbers because the clients we often work for, are generally doing better than these numbers might suggest.
The average roofing salesperson makes about $53,000 – $83,000 per year. Ideally, companies offer commissions so that roofing salespeople can scale as they make sales. You want stability and mobility in your sales compensation, so a salesperson can move up, but isn’t generally scared for their family or future – which could make them pushy or less effective.
Selling roofing services can be extremely difficult and isn’t for the faint of heart. Certainly, many siding and roofing make a solid living off of door-to-door efforts, but their inquiries are not always welcome or well-received. It can make life a lot easier if your salespeople have a blend of outbound, and inbound inquiries (from things like Thumbtack, Google Local Services, PPC, and Search Engine Optimization.) If you do have leads to provide to your salespeople it can allow them to not burn out so quickly, and keep their energy high. You don’t want them to only be dependent on leads the company gives, however, as a roofing contractor I’m friends with says – u0022They’ll turn into ‘lead babies.’u0022 Provide leads, but make sure they hunt for themselves as well.
**If you want to get more roofing leads in 2024** – I hope you take some of this guide to the heart and Trust yourself, and take responsibility for your company – and you will win. .

Not all blog posts are created equal — and if you’re going to invest time or money into blogging, you want every post to work for you.
Here’s a quick checklist to make sure your blogs actually drive traffic and leads:
  * : Write posts that answer real questions or solve real problems your customers have.
  * : Adding your city or service area into topics can help you show up for local searches.
  * : People (and Google) love clarity — not cleverness that confuses.
  * : Whether it’s a contact form, a free inspection offer, or even a related blog link, always guide readers to what’s next.


Great blogging is about meeting people where they are — giving them real value before they even pick up the phone.
Now, if you’re ready for a ton of proven ideas to get started, check out the list below!

Now that you have plenty of ideas to get you started on writing your first blog, you may be wondering, “How do I go about actually writing this thing?” Well, luckily we have a couple of tips to get you started.
The #1 purpose of blogging isn’t just to fill your website with content — it’s to .
When you consistently answer real questions and offer real solutions, Google starts recognizing you as an expert. Over time, this authority helps your content show up higher in search results — meaning more visibility, more traffic, and more leads.
Here’s how to make sure you’re writing about the right things:
  * : Find out what your ideal customers are actually typing into Google.
  * : Focus your blogs around real, detailed queries like “How much does a roof replacement cost?” instead of broad, vague topics.
  * : Sprinkle them into your headlines, subheadings, and body text without forcing it. Your post should still sound natural and helpful.
  * : Prioritize keywords that show the person is closer to making a decision, like “best roofing contractors near me” or “roof repair estimate.”


:Great blog topics often come straight from conversations you’re already having with customers. Pay attention to the questions people ask on the phone, in emails, or during estimates — then turn those into blog posts.
Need help getting started with keyword research?Here are a few of our favorite free (or low-cost) tools:
**Finding out what your audience is searching for is the first step toward writing blogs that actually get found — and get results.**
One of the fastest ways to stand out in a crowded market is to challenge the status quo. If there’s something your business believes strongly — especially if it goes against common industry practices — that’s content gold.
  * that no one else is addressing.
  * in your industry that you disagree with.


When you include a challenger viewpoint in your blog posts, you:
  * Show your readers that you’re — not just another company trying to sell them something.
  * Build instant trust by positioning yourself as an advocate, not just a service provider.


> “It’s just plain wrong for homeowners to have to worry about roofing scams that waste their time and money.”
Then, follow it up with a post titled to educate and empower your audience.
**Make your customers feel understood, protected, and empowered — and they’ll be far more likely to trust you with their business.**
Let’s be real — roofing content can get a little dry if you’re not careful.
Even though most roofing blogs are packed with valuable and helpful information, they aren’t always the most exciting reads for the average homeowner. That’s why it’s important to make your content as engaging and visually appealing as possible — using more than just your words.
Here are some easy ways to break up the “walls of text” and make your blogs more inviting:
  * : Add before-and-after project photos, roofing diagrams, or product images to help readers visualize what you’re talking about.
  * : Embed short explainer videos, behind-the-scenes clips, or customer testimonials to add variety and depth to your post.
  * : Link to product pages, warranty information, or related blog posts to guide readers to more resources.
  * : Use sparingly to add a little personality and energy without distracting from the main message.


At Hook, we make it a priority to ensure every blog post is easy on the eyes — using visuals and breaks to guide readers naturally through the content.
:Always make sure you’re using licensed stock images, your own project photos, or properly credited media from other sources. (It’s not worth risking a copyright issue just to add a picture!)
Engaging, well-formatted blogs don’t just look better — they perform better too. They keep readers on your site longer, increase trust, and ultimately drive more leads.
Here’s the truth: **most people don’t read blog posts word-for-word — they skim.**
That’s why it’s so important to make your posts easy to scan at a glance. If readers can quickly find the information they’re looking for, they’re far more likely to stick around, trust you, and take the next step.
  * : Aim for 2–4 sentences max per paragraph to avoid overwhelming your reader.
  * : Breaking out key ideas into lists makes them easier to digest (and way less intimidating).
  * : Clear, descriptive headings help guide readers through your content and highlight important sections.
  * : Start longer sections with a one-line summary to give readers a preview of what they’ll learn.
  * : Don’t be afraid to hit “Enter” more often. A little breathing room makes a huge difference visually.


:Imagine your reader is scrolling through your blog while standing in line at the store.If they can easily scan your post, find value fast, and feel smarter within 30 seconds — you’ve done your job.
The easier you make it to absorb your content, the more likely readers are to stay engaged, trust your expertise, and eventually become customers.
Writing a great blog is half the battle — the next step is making sure people actually see it. Here are a few practical ways to promote your posts after you hit publish:
  * : Post a short summary, pull a key tip as a teaser, and link back to the full article. Don’t just post once — share it a few times over a few weeks.
  * : Even if you only have 50-100 contacts, emailing your latest blog keeps your company top-of-mind and drives traffic back to your site.
  * : If you write a blog about “Signs You Need a New Roof,” link to it from your Roof Replacement page to boost SEO and help visitors dive deeper.
  * : Go back into older articles and link to your new post where it makes sense. This strengthens your website and helps with rankings.
  * : A catchy headline and an eye-grabbing image make a huge difference when sharing your blog across platforms.


A blog post isn’t “done” when you publish it — it becomes an asset you can use to educate, market, and convert new customers again and again.

  *   *   * 

Nonetheless, you should know that only a select few can give you your money’s worth of leads. As a roofer, it’s up to you to identify and reach out to these companies. 
To serve as an aid in your quest, we decided to discuss a few of these companies. The companies discussed below includes mainly roofing marketing agencies and agencies with roofers as part of their audience. Here are the first five niched companies that focus exclusively on roofers.
focuses on helping roofing companies grow through stellar lead-generation techniques and SEO practices. They are also well known for their competence in the roofing industry. Their services include:
They also offer unmatched market analysis to identify opportunities that’ll help your business grow.
If you’re looking for a high-end commercial roofing focused company to drive steady lead generation for your business, would be a great pick. 
Their forte includes supercharging your business’ website using refined SEO practices and using Google ads to generate leads. They’ve been around for a few years and are well-known amongst roofers.
With a ton of experience in the roofing industry, this roofing marketing company has proven itself as one of the best in lead generation. They utilize top tier analytical tools to deliver stellar marketing results and positive ROI. 
Their services also include the creation and optimization of blog posts and other online content.
than a regular roofing marketing company. They’re well known for equipping growth-oriented roofing companies with the skills and tools to grow.
With about 11-50 employees, they have helped countless roofers generate unreal numbers on their lead count over the past 10 years. They have their office located in New Jersey. This is one roofing marketing company you shouldn’t ignore.
focuses on helping their clients in stellar branding building, scaling their revenue and controlling lead flow through PPC or paid ads, Google ads, Facebook etc. 
With this, they’ve multiplied the revenues of several well-known innovative contractors in North America in the past few years. 
**Web Runner Media is one of the few marketing companies that are really committed to helping their clients grow**
Selecting a good lead generation company for your business can be a tricky task at times. In such cases, going for top tier companies like Hook Agency can be considered an option. 
You must have noticed that hook agency is not on the list of **we’re an option for the high-caliber top 10 percent of roofers headed from 1 million to 10 million in revenue** We love growth-oriented elite roofers, and we help build brands through industrial strength, SEO and content marketing.
Most early entrepreneurs value their time more than their money; that’s why the above list of agencies is there to make their selection process faster, and it’s way better than paying a contractor to help out.
As a roofer, you have to be honest with yourself about where you’re at on that journey. **If you’re in that “five hundred thousand to one million dollars in revenue” zone, you should be focused on making your business more profitable.**
**it’s better to start outsourcing elements of your marketing when you hit somewhere around that one million dollar mark in revenue.**
**Outsourcing elements of your marketing will help you free up your time to do other higher value activities. Depending** on your priorities, these activities may involve spending time with your sales staff, hiring and creating consistency with your processes.
There are just as many swindlers as there are legit  out there. Roofers often fall victim to these marketing scams when they don’t conduct thorough research before entrusting their lead generation activities to marketing agencies.
To avoid swindlers, be wise and identify what’s most appropriate for you when dealing with marketing or . If you contact any of the companies discussed above, you’d want to own whatever results you get.
When you contact the agency you wish to work with, **own the whole marketing process to understand what these marketing agencies do** because there are always companies out there that will take your money and not give you results of equal value.
that work with roofers as well as clients outside the roofing niche. A few of these companies are listed below.
“. Make sure that the agency you hire is doing , ensure that they’ve identified high-value marketing activities and are doing them repeatedly.
Summarily, a few thoughts on business growth you should pay attention to:
  * Make sure you understand what your lead generation company does with your money 
  * Delegate activities, whether it’s to a marketing agency or an internal marketing assistant. 


Understand that if you’re going to delegate any task or activities to someone or an agency, make sure you at least understand the basics of that task, and it’s something you can do moderately well.
Roofing aside, lead generation in any business is no trivial task, both in terms of avoiding scams and getting your money’s worth of leads. However, **how your roofing business survives all these processes and phases revolves around you as the owner**
It’s safer and better to know the ropes of your marketing rather than outsourcing it all to an agency with little or no supervision from your part.
At Hook agency, we offer lead generation services that’ll put you right in front of prospective clients while setting your mind at ease.

  *   *   * 

If you’re spending thousands on ads but not seeing deposits in your business account, listen up: 
This was the brutal reality check during the SearchLight Digital demo and live review. 
They pulled back the curtain on real marketing data and exposed a truth most (and even some agencies) don’t want to hear.
The takeaway? 
Marketing can bring customers to your driveway. Operations has to get the pen to the paper and the money in the bank.
Let’s break down how SearchLight blew up the old way of thinking and why every contractor who actually cares about making money needs to hear this.
Old-school marketing reports have been lying to you for years. Agencies bragging about impressions and clickthrough rates while your call board stays depressingly empty? 
SearchLight Digital flips that entire model on its head. Here’s how:
: No more tracking “vanity metrics” that don’t pay your bills. SearchLight tracks actual booked revenue, customer acquisition costs, and return on ad spend — not just leads.
: Data gets pulled directly from your ad accounts, CRM, and website. No one can massage the numbers to make themselves look good.
: You’re not just seeing how many people clicked an ad — you’re seeing how many booked a job, how much they spent, and how much it cost you to get them.
This isn’t just another dashboard cluttered with vanity metrics you’ll never use. SearchLight is a live, brutal truth serum for your business. 
If your sales team keeps dropping the ball, it’s right there in black and white. 
And if your marketing is actually performing but nobody is following up to close the deals, you’ll see it crystal clear. 
There’s no hiding behind fluffy numbers or slick presentations — SearchLight exposes exactly where you’re winning and where you’re bleeding money, so you can finally stop guessing and start fixing what matters.
During the demo, SearchLight dug into a real client’s numbers over the last 28 days. What they found should scare most straight.
The company spent just under across all channels. In return, they generated . On paper, that looks like a win, right? Wrong. Only into booked jobs.
That means nearly a was left dangling in open estimates. No contract. No invoice. No paycheck.
And here’s the kicker: the marketing worked. The ads got the right people to call. The leads came in. But the sales process broke down after that. 
**Marketing can drive the leads, but marketing can’t go into the customer’s home and close the deal.**
> “Marketing got you in the driveway. Operations needed to close — and they didn’t.”
When they zoomed specifically into Google Ads, the story stayed the same. The client spent , and generated — a solid 12x return if you include open estimates. But only about was actually realized in cash because of poor follow-up.
Their lead booking rate (how many leads turned into appointments) was , which is actually normal for the industry. So it wasn’t a lead quality issue. It wasn’t a marketing problem.
It was a follow-up and closing problem. 
If you think branding is just for big corporations, you’re dead wrong. Contractors who build brand awareness dominate their markets long-term. SearchLight proved it with hard data from branded ad campaigns.
  * The client’s (ads targeting people searching their business name) delivered a on ad spend.
  * dropped to , while the soared to .
  * They closed directly from brand name searches with barely $8,000 spent.


That’s what happens when people . They don’t search “AC repair near me.” They search because they trust you already.
If you want that kind of brand power, you’ve got to do the work that most businesses aren’t willing to do:
  * Sponsor local events, show up at home shows, and meet people face-to-face.
  * Invest in high-quality logos and photography that people emotionally connect with.
  * Hit traditional media — radio, TV, local papers — to stay in front of your community.


The result is simple: Your vans, your ads, your people become the first thing locals think of when they need help. And when they search your name instead of a category, 
Here’s what SearchLight made painfully obvious: if your open estimates consistently outweigh your closed sales, it’s an operations failure — not a marketing one.
The lead was created. The technician showed up. The time and ad dollars were spent. But if your team doesn’t follow up and close that estimate, you just paid for nothing.
If you want to squeeze more out of your marketing without blowing your budget, focus on this:
  * : Call back, text, and email prospects until you close or they say no.
  * : Teach them how to overcome objections and close deals on the spot.
  * : Make sure no estimate ever sits untouched in your CRM.
  * : Track how many estimates are followed up within 24 hours. Push for higher close rates.


You don’t need more leads. 
The truth is contractors love SearchLight even more than agencies do. Why? Because they show **the real path to more revenue — not just more leads.** Marketers like it too, but they have nowhere to hide. The transparency is total.
If you’re tired of guessing whether your marketing is actually working, SearchLight Digital gives you the kind of real, automated data that makes everything clear fast. No fluff, no games — just honest numbers showing what’s working and what needs fixing.
At Hook Agency, we’re not afraid to put our work under the microscope. We believe real growth comes from facing the data head-on, learning from it, and constantly getting better — not just trying to look good on paper. We work best with companies that value transparency, action, and real results over vanity metrics.
If that sounds like what you’re looking for, . We’d love to hear more about where you’re at, what you’re aiming for, and how we can help you close the gap between marketing activity and real revenue.

  *   *   * 

Solar is a sexy industry, but then – why are there so many solar website designs that barely show it.
Don’t represent your solar company with anything less than these 5 incredibly well-done examples of inspiration.
All across the country – a select few, elite growth-oriented solar companies are creating a dynamic impression that not only makes them look high-end, but drives leads and keeps their sales people busy.
Don’t believe me? Here they are! 5 Stunning Examples of Solar Website Design for 2022
This site utilizes a clean, illustrative feel that screams modern design. This site also utilizes our ‘Winning website formula’ – to drive more leads for this client.
**What’s the winning website formula? Glad you asked – it’s simple!**
  1. Clear call to actions to nudge people to the next step.
  2. An emphasis on persuasive imagery and headlines that are focused on the customer.


I absolutely love this amazing example of , designed by the lovely team over at .
  * Video background shows the product in all its glory. Interviews humanize the team


  * More video interviews with ideal customers that loved working with SunBadger


I love the way this design feels fresh with the green and blue color palette, and I love the headline that really focuses on their ideal customer rather than touting their own accomplishments. (This is how it should be done.)


  * Because text is positioned over images most of the time, the images get washed out, rather than having images full color. There are ways around this with modern design conventions like shape cutouts.


I like the bullet points at the top of this design, and the way the image has a 1/3rds, 2/3rds format to it that allows overlay of text without obscuring the picture. In this case it looks like this site is pitching more of the technology rather than services – but I really like the kind of dissected house illustration and the introduction of the solar panel cost to ROI calculator.


  * In this case – this is a website theme. And unfortunately working with commercial themes often bloat out the functionality of a website and lead to a slow-loading site, as well as sometimes forcing a company into concessions around the theme, rather than creating something that fits them like a glove.


What is awesome about this one – Well, I like the logo, I love the large, pleasant imagery.
I also love the value prop at the top and the financial specifics. Don’t assume that people checking out your website don’t also have 2 competitors up in the tabs next to yours.
People are price shopping – and looking for what makes you different than the competitors.
  * Quick icons at the top to get you to your next page.
  * Sharing ‘the problem’ with the #’s that communicate the environmental risk of the alternative.


  * I actually had to cut a lot of sections out of this screenshot because the site was so long scrolling. Watch out for overwhelming people, and consider offering a ‘sampler platter’ on the homepage rather than stuffing 20 sections right away. People can click into things they want to learn more about.


Talk to your sales team, and look into what’s really closing them deals.
Is it just the ‘green’ / environmentally friendly aspects of solar? If so – sure, make that front and center.
But also remember, that **every other solar installer on the planet can say the same things.**
People want to be SMART. Listen to them, hear why they are choosing YOUR company, and you’ll be surprised and come up with amazing new ways to talk about the value proposition, on your solar company website.
  * Solar can save them a ton of money over the long-haul
  * Rebates available in their area – or just sharing on rebates in general.


All of these are value propositions along with the obvious environmentally friendly aspects – just listen to what prospects are telling you and **use their language on the website for the most effective messaging.**

It’s packed with features, built for growing teams, and dominates the space.
Some businesses outgrow it. Others never quite get the hang of it.
The learning curve is steep. The cost isn’t light. And unless it’s set up just right, things can feel… clunky.
  * Why some teams are ready to move on from ServiceTitan
  * What switching actually takes (hint: it’s more than just dollars and cents)
  * And why keeps popping up as the go-to for companies that want a smoother experience


Ready to see what else is out there? Let’s dive in.
ServiceTitan can be frustrating — no doubt. But before you jump ship, it’s worth asking: 
Several have pointed out that a lot of the issues with ST come down to setup and training, not the software itself.
If your team never got fully onboarded, or if you’re not using key features the way they were intended, ST might feel heavier than it needs to.
  * – Companies like specialize in ST setup, workflows, and process improvement.
  * – An admin or dispatcher who already knows the system can help smooth everything out internally.
  * – ServiceTitan offers training to help your team actually understand (and get the most out of) the tools you’re paying for.


If you’re not crystal clear on you want to leave ST, you might just end up trading one set of problems for another. Get specific about the pain points before making a move.
Switching to a new CRM sounds simple in theory — until you start digging into what that actually involves.
First, a word of caution from someone who’s been there:
It’s not just about choosing a new tool. It’s about migrating every part of your workflow, and that gets messy fast.
  * – Photos, job notes, equipment model & serial numbers… all of it needs to be manually saved and reuploaded.
  * – If you don’t take the time to move them properly, your new CRM may just show generic invoice labels like “Invoice from ServiceTitan.”
  * – Everything from communication logs to equipment history might be at risk.


> _“If you wanted to transfer all the details of every invoice in ST, you would literally have to download and save each invoice then upload to your new CRM… We had to do everything manually.”_ — Kim Newton
And it’s not just data. It’s time. It’s training. It’s learning a whole new system — while still trying to run your business.
So yes, price might be what gets you about switching. But operations are what make or break the transition.
Before you move, make sure the next system solves your core issues — without creating new ones.
If you’re running a $5M+ business, not just CRM will do.
You need something strong enough to support a growing team — without the headache that often comes with enterprise-level software. That’s where a good ServiceTitan alternative stands out.
  * The platform should handle multi-user setups, job volume, and multiple trades (HVAC, plumbing, electrical) with ease. You shouldn’t outgrow it in a year.
  * You don’t want to spend months getting set up. A solid alternative should have a smoother ramp-up process — with helpful training resources and live support.
  * When things break or get confusing, you need answers fast. Look for a CRM known for responsive service, not generic ticket queues.
  * Think dispatching, job tracking, estimates, invoices, recurring service reminders, reporting, customer communication — all the essentials you’re used to in ST.
  * You may not need every advanced feature ST offers. Alternatives with more tailored pricing can deliver 80–90% of the functionality at a lower monthly cost.


The sweet spot? A platform that offers the power you need the bulk and bloat.
That brings us to the real-world alternatives contractors are trying — and what they’re saying about them.
When contractors consider moving away from ServiceTitan, several alternative platforms frequently come up in discussions. Each offers unique features, benefits, and potential drawbacks. Here’s a closer look at some of the most talked-about options:
FieldPulse is an all-in-one business management solution designed specifically for field service teams. It offers a comprehensive platform that assists users in managing various aspects of their operations, from scheduling and dispatching to customer relationship management (CRM) and financial documentation.
  * FieldPulse provides real-time updates, making task tracking more straightforward and enhancing customer communication with SMS integration.​
  * All customer details, communication history, job information, and payment records are stored in one centralized platform.
  * Users appreciate the intuitive design, which simplifies day-to-day operations.


  * Transitioning from another CRM to FieldPulse may involve manual data transfers, which can be time-consuming.​
  * Some users have noted that the system isn’t as customizable as they’d prefer, and there can be occasional bugs.


Small to mid-sized companies seeking an integrated solution to streamline operations without the complexity of larger platforms.​
Service Fusion is a field service management software that aims to simplify operations for service-based businesses.​
  * Many users find the system straightforward, noting that it simplifies billing and customer service processes.
  * Service Fusion integrates seamlessly with QuickBooks, aiding in inventory tracking and job costing.


  * Several users have expressed dissatisfaction with customer service, citing slow or nonexistent responses.
  * The mobile app has been described as clunky, especially when accessing invoices or large datasets in the field.


Businesses that prioritize integration with accounting software and are willing to navigate potential customer support challenges.​
FieldEdge offers a field service management solution with a focus on integrating directly with QuickBooks, allowing data to flow seamlessly between the two platforms.
  * The custom connector ensures that data between FieldEdge and QuickBooks remains synchronized, reducing duplicate entries.
  * FieldEdge provides tools for scheduling, dispatching, and customer management.


  * Exporting data from FieldEdge can be a manual process, requiring users to download reports and spreadsheets for import into other systems.
  * New users might find the system requires a period of adjustment to utilize all features effectively.​


Companies already using QuickBooks seeking a field service management tool that integrates closely with their accounting software.​
Simpro is a comprehensive field service management software designed to optimize scheduling, dispatch, and on-site service delivery.
  * Simpro offers professional services to assist businesses in transitioning to new software and migrating data, ensuring a smoother implementation process.
  * The platform provides customizable forms, actionable insights, and data integrations to meet specific business needs.


  * Given its comprehensive nature, Simpro might be more than what smaller businesses require, potentially leading to underutilization of features.​
  * The extensive features and professional services come at a premium, which might be a consideration for budget-conscious companies.​


Larger businesses or those with complex operational needs seeking a robust and customizable field service management solution.​
Breezy is a platform built exclusively for residential professionals, aiming to streamline operations and increase profitability.
  * Tailored specifically for residential HVAC companies, ensuring relevant features and workflows.​
  * The platform emphasizes ease of use, allowing teams to adopt and utilize the software quickly.​


  * While excellent for residential HVAC, companies in other trades might find the platform less suited to their specific needs.​
  * Being a newer entrant, there might be fewer user reviews and community support compared to more established platforms.​


Residential companies seeking a dedicated platform to enhance their operations without the complexity of broader field service management tools.​
At the end of the day, choosing the right CRM comes down to what works for your business — your team size, your trade focus, and how you like to operate.
Some platforms are packed with features but feel overwhelming. Others are lightweight but lack the muscle for growing teams.
That’s where seems to stand out for contractors, especially for the ones who want power, speed, and simplicity without the chaos.
Out of all the CRMs mentioned in contractor conversations, tends to fly under the radar — but when it comes up, people about it.
While ServiceTitan is known for its power and complexity, Housecall Pro is built to deliver what most home service businesses need — without the headache. It’s especially appealing to companies in that $3M–$10M range who are scaling fast and need a platform that keeps up without dragging them down.
  * Your team doesn’t need weeks of training or an outside consultant to get up and running. Most features feel intuitive out of the gate.
  * Setup is straightforward. You can start booking jobs and sending invoices in days — not months.
  * HCP has built a loyal user base and backs it with a library of videos, templates, and peer advice to help you grow. Their Facebook group alone is a goldmine of real-time support.
  * Despite its simplicity, Housecall Pro holds up for larger teams that are serious about growth — especially those looking to prioritize efficiency over enterprise bells and whistles.


  * Don’t want to spend weeks customizing workflows or building out reports


If ServiceTitan feels like too much, and some of the other alternatives feel like too little — might be just right.
A new CRM can open up a lot of possibilities, but only if you’re clear on you’re switching and what success looks like on the other side.
Before you pull the trigger, take a beat and ask yourself:
  * Is it pricing? Usability? Poor customer support? Or is it a training/setup issue with your current platform?
  * Even the best systems take time to implement. Do you have someone who can own the process?
  * Are you okay leaving some things behind — or do you need full access to past invoices, equipment logs, and notes?
  * Every switch comes with a learning curve. Is your staff open to change and ready to re-learn new systems?
  * **What kind of support will the new platform actually offer?** Onboarding, data migration help, live chat? Make sure you’re not going in blind.


These questions can save you thousands of dollars and weeks of frustration. The goal isn’t just to ServiceTitan, it’s to find a solution that fits your business better.
No CRM is perfect. Every platform has trade-offs — whether it’s complexity, cost, support, or the time it takes to get your team fully up to speed.
What matters most is that your software actually works for workflow, team, and goals.
If ServiceTitan feels like overkill or just isn’t clicking, you’re not alone. Plenty of contractors have been in the same spot, weighing their options and figuring out the best next move.
There are plenty of solid alternatives out there, each with their own strengths. 
For many, Housecall Pro stands out as a balance between functionality and ease of use, especially for growing teams who don’t want to spend months wrestling with software.
Take your time, ask the right questions, and choose the platform your team will actually enjoy using. That’s where the real ROI lives.

In today’s information-crazy world, homeowners’ minds are already occupied. If you’ll get their attention, then it means you’re putting out relevant content that addresses their specific needs. One excellent way to do that is to create videos. Ever heard of it?
These videos are part of what we call “Hookified elements” or “Hooks” to catch your leads. Without breaking your bank, you can raise your brand’s equity through these videos. They’re:
If there was a way you could go about this yourself, you sure don’t want to miss out on learning it! This article will help to explain what “They ask, you answer’ videos are, and some key points to look out for when making them. 
concept in your roofing sales requires you to compile a long list of answers to questions that customers frequently ask in your sales process. , that these questions are centered around topics known as “


videos are aimed at answering questions that stem from the big five areas. **It’ll be even more fun if you make these videos in the form of a podcast and post them on your social media or website!**
Because homeowners don’t understand all the technical stuff about roofing, it’s marketing-savvy to find the best ways of communicating with them in the simplest ways. Instead of using high sounding roofing-tech language, you can write down FAQs these homeowners might have and provide researched, up-to-date answers. This way, they’ll get more value from you.
Chances are, your average 80-year-old Joe homeowner doesn’t know what a “drip edge” is. And if he doesn’t know what drip edge is, he definitely won’t understand its pricing and quality. 
More reason why you should come up with attention-grabbing videos that’ll answer every single question that homeowners ask about your sales process, product or service.
, means assigning your best hands to each marketing element to ensure nothing goes wrong. **” videos requires the touch of at least one of the sales pros of your company**. It should either be you (the CEO), your founding partners, or some of your best sales guys.
**no one will put you through the wringer if your videos are not in the form of a podcast**. Any format is okay as long as it perfectly conveys your thoughts to your audience. You can get creative with formats like–
**podcasts are commonly used because they’re interactive and they help sales guys exude a feeling of trustworthiness** There are a myriad of topics that stem from the big five areas. The most common ones are on sales objections and roofing components and services pricing. Let’s discuss some of these topics and how to use them to close more deals.
**When you get objections in your sales process, it is usually because the homeowners you approach do not see how your product or service can solve their problems**
For instance, visualize yourself marketing roofing shingles to a 90-year-old homeowner with a mouth-watering warranty as your main selling point. He’ll might just tell you – “** _Son, warranties don’t matter to me, I don’t have much time left.”_** For objections like this, it’s best to identify other features of your product that suit his needs and make them your main selling point. 
At times, you might even meet homeowners that’ll tell you that they can’t employ your services because you use subcontractors or work too fast. That’s why **you must make a compilation that encompasses every single objection and create videos to address every last one of them**
**incorporate these videos into your website to boost your click-through rate**. Eventually, the leads you get through this method have higher chances of converting.
of companies would rather preach marketing stuff to people, even if they continuously get ignored. They bluntly refuse to let go of their outdated marketing ideas. 
In this day and age, they refuse to believe that answering customer questions can also be considered clever marketing. **Aside from questions about your pricing, most homeowners prefer to know what the whole sales process will feel like when a sales guy knocks on their door**
At this point, you might start getting questions like – “** _Am I going to sit through three hours with a salesperson?_****_Are those sales guys going to force me through something?_** Answering these sorts of questions takes a lot of pressure off of homeowners, making the whole sales process an easy-breezy, feel-good daily routine.
The main reason why most roofers don’t make videos about the specifics of their prices is based on the fact that they’ll have to explain their pricing in detail. As a salesperson, it’s not like you can go around explaining why you’re expensive to every homeowner you meet. That will be bothersome. 
However, no one wants to make a high-dollar purchase without knowing the exact price beforehand. **So why not make a series of videos that explains everything there is to know about your pricing and integrate them into your website?** To spice things up, you can even throw in functions like a roof cost calculator!
Sure, adding your pricing to your web content might scare away some leads. However, know that the leads you lose had pretty low chances of converting since you’ll have to disclose your prices at some point anyways.
**incorporating your pricing in your website will help you generate only quality leads by filtering out folks that aren’t satisfied with your price**. Think of this method as some sort of “Lead Filter”.
Once in a while, you can talk about why other companies are cheaper instead of always discussing why you’re expensive. However, **make sure you don’t take shots at any company specifically**. Doing that could have you and your competitors firing salvos at each other!
videos can be considered a training method since members of your team or employees also watch your videos. 
That’s why you must make these videos as illuminating as possible to your clients and roofers. Even your receptionists and customer support need to have an idea of the questions that might come through calls.
“They ask, you answer” videos speaks to prospective clients because you’re showing empathy when addressing their concerns. You have to make them understand that you’re in touch with their situation and give them enough breathing space while doing so. 
At least enough breathing space to keep them from viewing your company as a company that pressurizes its clients. Even if you don’t close any deals at the end of the day, you should ensure that the roofer they pick is trustworthy and capable. **Your secondary goal should be ensuring roofers are again trusted in the industry.**

## Page: https://hookagency.com/blog/website-footers

  *   *   * 

Website footers are the most under-rated, and powerful element of website design. Great footer design caps off the end of the site, are an amazing place for ‘calls-to-action’, contact information, and navigation. They seem to be under-rated because some people focus exclusively on the ‘header’ or the top of the website, and the ‘billboard’ of the website, ‘above-the-fold’ / or visible before you scroll.
Though the top of the site matters – the footer can be extremely powerful and serves as the other half of the ‘frame’ of a website – or the other element that stays consistent throughout the site, despite the middle content that swaps out on every page. **Because you see the footer on every page, if it’s done right – all of the work is compounded in a positive way throughout the .**
For each of these awesome footers – I’m going to briefly go through what I love about , and how you could potentially use the principles from these footers for your footer designs as well.
We recently designed this for a luxury condo construction client. What I love about it is that while it’s dark, simple, contrasty, it utilizes a variety of almost black color hexes to still show a clear division of elements within the UI.
This is a footer we designed for a heavy civil construction client. This footer works well because of the white bold font (Gilroy) over the blue overtoned image, as well as the engaging headline question. I love the idea that even in the footer, you aren’t done answering and solving your clients problems. 
landing pages are a lot of fun to design because they can defy a lot of the convetional UX we might use for a regular website. We can more precisely guide what interactions we want the user to take to keep them hooked in an on the page. This footer works well with the engaging hero image combined with the CTA and lead cap form. 
Many might see it as a risky move to not put sitemap links in the footer but in my opinion it really matters on the scale and goals of the business. We designed this footer as part of a website for a side project of an already existing client and it works because their business is currently small and focused on getting leads into their space. We focused on that goal by leaving out extraneous items and having a prominent map with contact info. 
This is a new footer we designed for a financial services client of ours. We knew from the beginning their footer had to contain a lot of links so we took advantage of the size and added additional emotional imagery and headlines to keep the user engaged. We followed the notion that no space should be left untouched with this design. 
This is a footer we designed for a client in a creative agency industry. What I love about this is that it utilizes columns and big vertical spacing to create different sections. By using gray on gray tones with font, we’re able to give emphasis to some elements over others and guide the user to what it is we want them to do. 
I’ve been really digging this light pink for a couple of years now, and this footer delivers on a lot of things that make love design. The strong contrast between the logo, UI elements and the submit button – as well as the bold simplicity and centering of the menu, and social icons. (Check out this .)
This marketing agency doesn’t shy away from utilizing the bottom of every page, with a quick sentence about what makes them special. Then it moves into copyright, a ‘start a conversation’ call-to-action, a couple of key items they may want you to view, social icons and functional ‘terms/privacy policy’ pages. They then have a caveat about the opinions of the people on their podcast. Use this concept by being open to dropping elements back with a grey that’s not much different than the dark grey background. This makes the other elements stick out more.
Clearly – this agency is much more focused on recruiting great talent (with a kind-looking, smiling face of course, as a background photo) than just getting more business on their home page. They’ve opted for brutal simplicity in their website footer, with just a conversational call-to-action, a slim navigational element, and social icons. Use this concept by really simplifying down to just a very few next actions you’d think people would want to take.
My god, this footer is good. Perhaps I’m just a sucker for black and white , but when you have this simple of a color palette, the layout of the elements has to be extremely thoughtful in the way they’re arranged. Use this concept, by balancing the number of navigational elements on either side – and centering a few of the next (obvious next step) actions you’d want people to take.
If you want to amp up the color instead of playing it down, what about a rainbow-esque footer? Use this concept by making introductions of each of your key pages at the bottom of your site, each with their own corresponding color.
Just the logo in white, the navigation, a subscription box, Terms links, social icons, and a copyright. Use this concept by opting for a little more built out footer, without going too far. Of course you’ll need your logo in white – it’s funny how nice this looks, as I’ve tried this recently on a lot of designs, and it really adds a pleasant little touch.
This is for a fashion brand, and having worked on clothing company websites before – I can say it’s a unique place to be able to express yourself with brutally simple elements. The context of this type of footer is key of course – as not a lot of companies could get away with this. Use this concept on your next clothing brand website, by cutting out all the clutter, sticking with one action, and 5 links at the bottom of the page (in this design’s case – two of them are social media links.)
I love contact forms in footers. This is a wonderful example of a very robust footer, that still comes across as clean to me. Use this concept by incorporating a contact form in your footer on 1/3rd or half the design, and calling out recent blog posts in the the other half under your contact information.
###  – don’t act like you’re not impressed 
We fit a lot into our footer design, without making it feel cluttered. Use this concept – by moving towards a very simple 3 column layout with understated typography.
You want your website footer to be functional, not just beautiful. We know to expect navigational elements at the end of the page, but people expect to see contact info as well. Here are a couple of other things that may make sense to include in a footer design.
  * Obvious next steps – they’re done with the website now, so what would they do now ideally?
  * What is a list of possible next actions they might take?
  * Ideally, perhaps a contact form, if you want it to be super simple for them to get in touch?
  * I like having badges of organizations a company is a part of so that people can understand the company is part of a community and is trustworthy, not some lone wolf company that doesn’t follow best practices.
  * Social icons so they can join in on the discussion, and perhaps follow you on other platforms.

The problem with most website inspiration posts is that they don’t give enough, quickly enough.
You have to go hunting all around the web – just to get 3 projects that can inspire you. (especially if you’re into , like us!)
If you do feel like hunting – here are 5 other places, we have 3 fresh examples for 2025, and 48 total inspiring websites from the past couple years.
**Here are 5 other places quick to find Website Design Inspiration in 2022**
  1. Behance – Look in the interaction design category or 
  2. Awwwards – look , find elements you like – be wary of getting too obsessed with Awwwards because there stuff tends to be too bleeding edge for most business (besides often being horrible for usability.)
  3. Our site! Check out our , our , , , , , , , and .


These are just inspiration pieces! Don’t forget your main audience 
Some key points that are inspiring about this particular example:
  * The overlapping and under-stated section elements like the newsletter subscription section.


Great example of stacking the important stuff up top – in the exterior industry, many customers don’t scroll much but judge quickly.
  * Pleasant photography of family in front of their beautiful home.
  * High contrast white on black background and vice versa elements.
  * Calling out key elements with red to draw attention to them.


Farnham Text Bold (check out this post on ) looks beautiful on this bold but simple apartment design website:
  * Choosing a lifestyle photo that captures the feeling you want customers to envision for themselves.
  * Mixing a bright version of a color in with a simpler, deeper shade of the same color.


> Most designers live in some sort of alternate reality, creating unnecessary things for each other. Then they become trends. – Webflow commenter, BlazeJ



  * Angles of images makes the website feel completely custom and unique to client.
  * Form right away captures customers that know what they want.


  * Figures in images or illustrations break the field / feel like they are coming at you.
  * Mobile menu is in the bottom right for usability (that’s where your thumb usually is!)



2020 is right around the corner, and with the new year comes new trends. You can probably only think of a handful of websites you used in the past year that were memorable and stuck out based on the aesthetic appeal and ease of use.
With all the websites out there, giving users an experience to remember is becoming something that is not just desirable to have, but something that is expected.
We hope you enjoy some of these curated designs below – and their fresh styles that are making a major impact in the world of website design this year – 
We serve and home service companies with marketing + web design! Check out our blog posts about , , , , and our , , , , and !
The rotating animation trend leaves users curious about what else is on the site because there is a new image or surprise whenever you leave the page and move to another. Fun things like this give users a unique experience with your website whenever they go on it.
We have noticed that scrolling techniques are becoming more popular in website designs. This type of horizontal scrolling is sure to catch the attention of whoever is using it while also being something that is very simple and functional on the site. It will be exciting to see how this technique is utilized in 2020.
Having user interactivity on your website is becoming increasingly popular. This design has consumers spending more time on websites using this feature and interact with the design.
This website was found on in their Hot web design trends to look for in 2020.
It uses 3D elements in its design, which help to make it more impressive and memorable. The purpose of using 3D is to give the viewer a feeling of depth, making them look more attractive.
On the 2020 design inspiration from , they list this website from Igor for scroll animation. There is also a website called Covered from Awwwards website that has this design technique. This scroll animation design is becoming more and more popular. It is an excellent way for you to increase your time on page and engagement with users. Just be sure that your animations don’t get too crazy and distract the viewer from the reason they went to the site in the first place.
This design of the Revols website comes from 21 award-winning websites and what they did right on the website. This image is great for having big typography and showcasing their product up close and personal.
This website also comes from list of 21 award-winning websites and what they did right.
In regards to the previous two images, placing large images as the background is a trend that is getting more and more popular, and like we said last year, it is still a modern and popular trend.
The white space trend on websites has been a popular option for the last couple of years and does not appear to be leaving anytime soon.
When you’re looking for ways to improve something, looking towards the experts in that field is never a bad option. Doing this helps you to learn from people around you and find a path you are able to follow on a regular basis.

Building a new website is exciting for a company. You can create a whole new image for your brand and company and tailor it towards your niche. However, if your website doesn’t match the way you want to be perceived, it will not perform as optimally as it should. Hook Agency loves working with companies to help get them the best results possible. If you are looking to build a new website, reach out to us, and we’ll get your business rockin’ n rollin’.
Some of the niches we serve: & , & , & , &. We also drive leads for all kinds of , including , , , and .
Recently, we talked about some , such as integrated animation, particle backgrounds, bold typography, and color . To accommodate that post, here are some gorgeous websites that will feature some of those trends, as well as some other design techniques to look for this next year, like the use of white space, 3D images, and using high-quality photos. Use these 
These two modern websites take advantage of integrated animation but take it to a whole new level.
Big, bold typography is used in these two sites, which allow them to highlight the benefits of their business offering for the user.
Websites that are heavily saturated with one specific color and tone are visually appealing and engaging.
Websites that are predominately white have been popular in the last couple years. In 2019 we’ll continue to see our fair share of these simple, minimalistic designs. Also, note how the first website has asymmetrical elements, another 2019 trend.
Large images as the background with text overlaying is sure to be a modern and popular trend that will only increase in usage over the next few years.
With long loading times, a key reason for users leaving sites, keeping the user engaged with an animation on the loading screen can help you retain those impatient users.
Popular brands like Spotify continue to use on their app, which illustrates that gradient is here to stay for a while.
While using 3D images on your website is going to take a little more time, it can add a whole new element of depth and visually appealing detail to your site.
If you know me, you know I love local casual menswear brand Askov Finlayson, so I had to give a shoutout to their website too. The Minnesota company takes the time to use nicely shot, crisp, clear photos that emphasize their brand values. The lesson here: avoid stock images when possible. Now, you can find some good images online that fit your brand well, but make sure you view them as placeholders rather than permanent.
A great example of using particle backgrounds with your website. This site looks great and runs smoothly.
62% of companies polled said they believe a website should be redesigned every 2-3 years. Source: 
are getting more and more publicity as of late with the Netflix documentary, and a couple of books about it like “” and it’s follow up “.”
The original idea of minimalism was characterized as “a trend in sculpture and painting that arose in the 1950s and used simple, typically massive forms.”
Today it is characterized by white space in decor, fewer things – smaller wardrobes, a lack of trinkets that don’t “inspire you, or add joy to your life.”
In can be a notable lack of variety in features, typefaces, colors, or big chunky areas of white, dark, or other flat colors.
When your product is excellent, and there is a deep emphasis on its contours, it’s shape, and it’s elegance – then simply photographing it well and finding a few solid thematic elements (in this case a gold overlay box, and a gold outline box) and deeply considering your typographic choices will draw out the natural beauty.
Simple rectangles and type – the Affair also then makes use of the simple white and grey figures in it’s featured photography to give a very sparse, luxurious, and open appeal.
White balloons, white table, white bike, white chair – this website is stripped of color very intentionally. If you do this kind of design, it becomes all the more important to balance the remaining elements and create the right appeal with your font choices.
To be 100% honest with you – I don’t even know what this site is selling. Perhaps just this gloriously simple bottle of water for an exorbitant price? Hey – I’d think about buying it… just because of how good this site looks. European websites have been going minimal for years, and some of the aesthetic is just now starting to hit the more pop culture-focused design of the United States.
The idea of a more minimalist approach to web design is that the few things you leave behind when subtracting are only the absolute most important elements that will bring the composition together. In this case, there are more stylized elements behind the products – these design elements go upwards and at an angle to draw the viewer’s eye along the page, and the circular parts give a cohesive feel to the page with the circular products in the foreground.


Without further ado – the examples I found of great design:
Pastels, soft colors in photography/fashion, and clean design.
Bright colors behind black and white, outlined squares used to frame other photographic elements.
White elements used as user interface design whitespace.
: Bright colors interspersed with heavy white space and clean user interface elements.
Gradient overlays that move and evolve. (You’ll have to go to the live site to see this in action)
Big photography, clean design and ‘things arranged neatly’ with overhead photography.
The way to level up is to find the ‘model for excellence’, and to follow that model on a regular basis. So I strongly suggest not just looking at the designers or people around you, but rather branching out and learning from the best of the best.
This site regularly refreshes its examples and awards the best web designers monthly. Insanely good examples, of people that are pushing the boundaries of website design.
**– sharing new color schemes every day.**
New color schemes and combinations are essential – and I absolutely love this curated account. It’s nice to have something that just shows up in your Instagram feed, without having to go seek it out.
Great web design isn’t just about the aesthetics – but about the way, it feels to interact with a design. I love Codrops for this reason – they’re constantly sharing code for free that will help make your final products look amazing.
These three simple steps will help you get better every week with your web design skills!
**2. Bookmark this and other posts that make you excited about design.**
**3. Write about everything you’re learning on a weekly or monthly basis.**
New websites are an exciting time. It’s an opportunity to rebrand your company and finely tune it to your current demographics needs.

If this article isn’t giving you enough inspiration to work with, there are a number of online color palette generators to help you out! We’re big fans of Hubspot’s color palette generator pictured below:
Taking some more inspiration from fashion and painting company color trends, we’ve curated 7 additional color schemes that are sure to be popular throughout the new year. This year, bright colors and jewel tones are highlighted, as well as a few prominent muted shades (one of them taking the cake as “Color of the Year”). Be sure to draw inspiration from any of these color schemes, and it will definitely help to , and level up whatever web design project you’re taking on next. 
The color scheme of this money app website almost perfectly reflects some of the colors included in . In both fashion and web design color trends, you can expect to see plenty of traditional shades (like this classic blue), but also bright and bolder tones that add a sense of revitalization to whatever color scheme they are included in. 
It seems like one of the “It” colors on the runways of this upcoming year may be this orange shade. So, we’re back with another grayscale palette that includes a bright pop of color, that color being hot orange. This website design shows that bright colors can still come across as luxurious and high-end when used correctly. 
curated a list of every “2022 Color of the Year” announced thus far by painting companies. By far, some variation of this muted green color seems to be the most popular shade. This e-commerce website incorporates this popular shade in a very simple way using a background image, showing that your website design doesn’t necessarily have to be overly complicated to look cohesive and professional, especially when using the right colors.
The citrus-y color scheme gives off a fresh and vibrant feel, and it definitely works to make this web design more exciting, even though the layout is quite simple.
Another major color trend is the use of jewel tones, and they are great to include in web designs.  color report highlights plenty of dynamic jewel tones that give off an expensive vibe. This Regent5 website design also has an expensive feel, communicated by the deep blues and purples incorporated throughout the site.
The popular colors in our post-COVID society are ones that . After the past couple of years of isolation, people want to wear and see shades are soothing and invigorating at the same time. This website color scheme does a great job of including natural/organic shades that are exciting at the same time. 
is another one that is going to be popular in both fashion and web design. This color scheme is heavily influenced by technology trends and mobile apps that are already prominent in our society like Spotify and Lyft. This just goes to show the influence that technology tends to have on our preferences, especially post-COVID.

A new idea can come from anywhere, so remember that it’s okay (and encouraged) to use various forms of design like fashion and interior to influence your web design brainstorming, especially when thinking about color trends. 
Website color schemes for 2025 – will include a lot of use of photography to solidify the color scheme – a lot of shape cutouts out of white, and a splash of similarly bright colors that draw your eye, but then settle you into deeper – natural colors with the use of earth tones, and deeper hues.

Elements of color are essential not only in the way they pair with other complementary shades but also in the quantity and placement in relationship to those other colors and in how it relates to other patterns and photographic elements next to it and elsewhere on the website. In this section, I will share/curate websites with beautiful color schemes, hexadecimal codes, and just a brief note about why color being used works in context as well.
#b11a21 – In an overlay, juxtaposed against flat blue, the photographic background gives depth.
#e0474c – The smiling face coming through the red, makes it feel striking.
#7acfd6 – The flat blue provides a contrast to the photo behind the red. 
#f1f0ee – Simple light grey is used to provide depth behind a later photographic section, with white below.
#CAE4DB – Never underestimate a color palette created by a photograph to set the tone of your design.
#DCAE1D – In this case, the palette is set with the photo and then echoed in the subtitle.
#00303F – Cerulean is incredibly classy as a black or dark grey alternative if used consistently throughout.
#7A9D96 – This clean, natural color is established in the photo but could be used on a lower full-width block or buttons as well.
#393939 – Dark designs take a little bit more fore-thought but can provide tons of contrast if used well. 
#FF5A09 – With different shades of oranges, there is depth and gradient, without venturing into totally new colors. 
#ec7f37 – Utilizing illustrative elements, requires a bit of flexibility for the natural lightness and darkness to contour objects. 
#be4f0c – Using on color over on the color wheel can keep the palette looking classy, bold, and restrained.
#4ABDAC – Once again the color overlaid over the photographic elements provides a classy modern touch
#FC4A1A – A figure in the foreground is worked into the context, still paying attention to how it complements the overall structure of the design. In fact, one might even be able to surmise that the design was down around this figure. 
#F7B733 – The Yellow provides only a juxtaposed call to action and highlights important parts
#DFDCE3 – Clean grey, utilized in the photograph, keeps the structure un-encumbered by more colors or patterns in these sharp headshots.
#368cbf – Blue wins for trust in color psychology, but make sure it’s a tasteful hue, as some blues are too out of the box. Just like my art teacher said with paints, you should always mix them before applying to canvas, lest you get something that looks like you just slapped the colors out of the box. 
#7ebc59 – Corporate Blue + Eco-conscious green = Every website ever. But don’t overlook the use of common color schemes just because their common. Wield familiar colors together when it serves your purpose of feeling trustworthy. 
#33363b – Breaking up white space with a darker header, footer, or full-width sections provides relief from things that are too repetitive. 
#eaeaea – This truly is one of the most common color schemes around the website, particularly for technology companies. Are you sick of it yet? I like it.
**The vital part of this section is a reminder that colors don’t live in a vacuum.** How they relate to each other is complex, and pairing them not only with other colors that complement them but in degrees and quantities that work well together is important. When I show that orange and yellow are working well together, always keep in mind the context and how much of each are present. There might be a tiny sliver of yellow, so it’s not just that they work well, but how much of each and where.
Taking color out of the mix entirely – for certain parts of a website – or composition, in general, can be a classy yet straightforward way to increase the seriousness, or elevate the intensity of a piece. This is evidenced by how we feel when we see a black and white photo; either we sense certain self-importance or appreciate the simplicity and recognize an air of positive sophistication.
This concept and tone are also present in websites where only one color and various hues of that color are used, allowing the eyes to rest and revel in all that is blue, or all that is green, or 3 shades of purple. **I will also include some monochromatic + 1 color schemes** which mean black, white, any shades of gray plus one other color, and it’s shaded. The same general principles are at play in each of these scenarios. By eliminating all other colors except a select few, you can actually enhance the way the few remaining colors play together and increase the dramatic tension of the website – if it’s done well.
In the end – the website design alone won’t sell more stuff if that’s your goal. Combine these high-end styles with Search Engine Optimization to get more leads.
#262626 – Repeat after me, all grays are not equal
Found on , Work by 
This color scheme, of course, also demonstrates what a great photo can do for the overall look of your site if juxtaposed with the strong contrast of the flat color elements.
#201d3a – Not quite B&W+1 – Hint of purple in the corner of the photograph
**And a couple more greyscale websites to make it abundantly clear that greyscale can be extremely beautiful.**
This whole section calls to mind how much we overlook the use of negative space in design and rely instead on our ability to fill space. Leaving white space and filling only a portion of it intentionally establishes a sophistication in design, and now crowded frills can beat. Pair this sensibility with a tasteful choice of typographic elements and well-crafted photographic assets to make anything look high-end.
Typography, color, layout. None of these elements stand alone in any composition, and to talk about one without the other leaves an incomplete picture. Always be paying attention to how the character of your plays with your typographical elements. should be hand-selected for their attributes, not selected haphazardly.
by , Available on MyFonts – By taking the high-end feeling gold gradient and pairing it with very intentional shaped typographic elements, the designers of this site juxtaposed the rugged and elegant.
– Available through – Looks gorgeous as a testimonial or call out quote.

– is as classic as it is simple. Common similar like Gotham Black, Montserrat, or Proxima Nova can allow you a similar but different flavor. Still, Futura Bold will be useful for a lot of situations – and plays well in this simple red, gray, tan color scheme as uppercase titles.
– As both the 100 weight in the blockquote above and the paragraph text (font-weight: 400), Museo Slab provides readability, whether big and small. Futura, Museo Slab over these comfortably simple colors feel not necessarily classic, but modern and original. The restraint in both color choices and typography leads to a very cohesive feel that leaves the whole website feeling integrated and branded.
– I love the look that many modern European websites achieve with this mature, swiss feeling typeface. It’s going to see a lot more use in America before it gets overdone here. The no-frills application below shows you the confidence with which a lot of European designers are using it. Impeccably played.
No matter what colors you use, your website will be better if it uses a very well thought out typeface or two. Finding a balance between the color and the fonts is not necessarily scientific – it requires a certain poetic association, but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely subjective. The colors can either be diametrically opposed to the personality/personalities of the typeface(s), or be in direct alignment with them.
**Using descriptive words like ‘masculine,’ ‘feminine,’ ‘rugged,’ ‘classic,’ ‘clean,’ ‘modern,’ and ‘expressive,’ can help you talk about color schemes and typefaces with your clients and others working on your design with you.** It’s important not to get caught up in the semantics – or meanings of the words – too strictly. Rather, use them as they are useful to you and discard them as soon as they become contentious.
The crucial piece is that your designs serve the purpose that they are intended for – . By taking some time to start projects with a color scheme that meets the emotional needs of the prime demographic, you are setting them up for success. At it’s most basic level, that means not making a website for men purple as it’s statistically their least preferred color. You also wouldn’t want to make a medical website black as it connotates death, or giving a very light and airy yellow color scheme for a serious subject lest it insinuates frivolity. 
At it’s most acute, intention in a means communicating the brand voice, the emotional appeal, occasionally being open to things previously learned by others (green for an environmental project, blue for a technology project, red for sports and aggression,) and following your instinct as you dive headfirst into what would truly speak to this particular market. The greatest designers were all guessing, too, and took a stab at something new. Jump in, soak up what’s already out there in the particular market the product or service is in. Then, look at the most visually appealing and effective designs in all markets and try your hand. After you’ve tried some pre-mixed hex color schemes listed above or elsewhere – mix up your own.
[bctt tweet=”“The greatest designers were all guessing too and took a stab at something new.””]
**Recognize your hidden powers, trust your creative instincts, and get your hands dirty.**
Well, I’ll tell you one thing a modern color palette is not using super simple versions of the colors we traditionally think of: blue, green, yellow, etc. Regardless of if you can make simple colors look good together or not – it seems unsophisticated and relatively bland. I remember my painting teacher in college saying always to mix your paints with intention at the beginning of a session – because people who just squeeze them out of a tube are going to find the look of their painting drab indeed.
**What we want is a modern color palette that appeals to the refined tastes of today’s consumer. It can be bold and fresh, or earthy and rusty – but it should never look haphazard.**
There are obviously a lot of choices to choose from when it comes to the colors you choose for your website. Lucky for you, some great online color scheme generators can help you find the perfect fit for you.
With an easy click-to-copy feature, you can paste the HEX codes the existing color schemes they already have available.

The Palette Generator is an awesome way to help turn your favorite landscape, cityscape, or any photo into a color scheme. Easily upload a picture, and this tool does the rest.
Another tool that allows for highly customizable colors; Paletton is a great app for expanding your color scheme repertoire.

Blue is definitely the safest choice since it has the highest number of people saying it’s there favorite at 35%. However – clearly, if your competitors are all using blue, it might make sense to ‘differentiate’ your offering and brand. Your brand colors should be appealing, and ‘white space’ is an important part of that. Make sure you give space to the elements you do include, have a contrast between text and backgrounds, and don’t overwhelm the visitor – trying to be too flashy or being novel just for the sake of novelty.
Consider that 51% of brands choose monochrome logos, 39% use two colors, and only 19% of companies choose full-color logos. Besides photographs, 1, 2, and 3 color websites seem to be easier to pull off well than trying to make a website with a rainbow of colors. That being said – if you have a professional designer, clearly Microsoft and Google believe there’s a benefit of working with more colors as they both use at least 4 solid colors in their design.
Choosing a color scheme is tricky – but there are far more heavy-duty problems in a website design that may benefit from the help of a seasoned designer. Professional web designers have tried 100’s of things and realized what methods do and don’t work – ideally, if you work with a team like Hook Agency they’ve also A/B tested websites, made changes based on Analytics, and know how to make your website easy to find on Google.
We know how to do amazing things like this very cool FAQ add-on to our listing here on Google. We know how to wield your website on Google through a practice calledSearch Engine Optimization’ – so, beyond website color schemes, we know how to DRIVE BUSINESS from Google traffic.

Getting more business opportunities is something that many companies constantly find themselves looking for. After all, more business is what makes you more money. 
When you are busy running a business, it can be challenging to find new ways to gain more leads and potential customers. 
Use this list of proven methods for lead generation for windows and door replacement companies. 
When you bring Search Engine Optimization into your marketing, you will have more pages show up on Google that is in your niche from improvements that have been made on your website. 
The most effective SEO companies will utilize strategy content, earn high-quality backlinks from other sites that will link back to yours, and make technical changes. These techniques will get your website to rank higher on Google search ranking and will get more people to come across your website bringing you more leads in the process. 
If you want to find out more about what exactly an SEO company does, check out  post that talks about what an SEO company does in simple terms you can understand.
If you are looking for a company to bring you more leads, Hook Agency is a great choice for getting your company to rank higher. 
YouTube is one of the biggest search engine platforms in the world with only Google being above them. 
One of the coolest things about YouTube videos is that they are also able to rank as a search result in Google so you can get more people to view your content. 
This content strategy is used by many businesses so they can drive traffic back from their YouTube video back to their website. With the video being posted to YouTube, you need to have a call to action that will motivate the viewer to visit your website when they are done viewing the video. 
A good tip to get more people back to your site is not to sell them on the YouTube page, but provide them with more information that will bring them to your website and sell them there. 
Social media is a great way for you to connect with prospective customers and display your talents in the window and door installation niche. 
A majority of small businesses use social media as a part of their digital marketing strategy which means if you are not, they could have a leg up on you. 
The type of media that you would be posting would be focused around useful information for people that are looking for new windows and doors and what they would want to know. 
The relationship between SMM and Social Media Advertising is similar to that of SEO and SEM. SMM parallels SEO in that it’s all about giving the social media platform what it wants, fresh content to push to its users. SMM and social media advertising are ways to pay for that traffic instead.
Social media advertising is focused on putting your social media content in front of users the social media platform knows are interested in your company’s products or services. Social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram know who these users are because of the information they have on these users and their accounts. 
If you are a small local business, it is important that you are targeting local users around your area. The amount of detailed information Facebook has on its users is pretty remarkable. 
They know who to place the ads in front of and who is most likely going to click on those ads and depending on the amount of money you’re willing to dish out, will place those ads in front of others. 
Using local industry directories are a great way for you to acquire backlinks to grow your website’s search ranking. They are also a great way for locals to find any services they may need with all the businesses in the area that offer that particular service and can go right to their website. 
You want to be sure that your business’s information is consistent across all of the directories you are listed in. Adding photos of homes that have your windows and doors installed is another great way for you to boost yourself from the competition. It can help drive more traffic onto your site over others in the directory because you are showing the work you have done and they can feel more comfortable with your company because of it. 
Email marketing can be a powerful tool for businesses to utilize. It is able to drive traffic to your website from prospects and customers who are interested in the links within the email. 
In order for you to build up a list of names for your email marketing, you need to find a way to motivate them to give you their information. Think about past situations you were in where a business was able to get you to sign up for their email updates and what it was that motivated you. 
One popular strategy that is used to get people to sign up for email lists is giving something away for free. Something a window or door installation company can do for this is to offer people a free estimate. For this person to receive their free estimate, they have to sign up and schedule their appointment. 
This can be placed on several parts of your website or as a pop-up that comes onto your page after a few seconds. You are also able to place it at the end of each blog article or put it as a link in your YouTube video description. 
One way to make your word of mouth work as effective as possible is by handing out business cards. 
This ensures that your happy customers will pass your card out to friends and neighbors that are in need of your services.
On each piece of direct mail, there is information about the business and some sort of call to action to visit the business website. The best call to action to use are coupon codes offering discounts on installations or products. 
Your call to actions need to give the customer something in order to get them to visit your website. It may sound like a simple task, but it is important to remember that they have many options to choose from and you want them to give them a reason to choose you over the competition. 
You are missing out on a lot of possible business if you do not have a website. It is one of the best tools you can use to get more business because it gives people a place to find out more about your business, contact you, and purchase things with just a couple of clicks. 
At Hook Agency, we have created a process to create a website that will fit with your company and its goals to build your brand. 
Hopefully, this list of proven methods of lead generation for window and door replacement companies gives you a few more ideas on the options you have for your companies lead generation. 
There are many options out there for us to choose from, but it is all about finding the ones that work best for you. 
We wish you the best of luck in the building of your business and If you are looking for SEO services or a website, contact Hook Agency and we’ll discuss your business and goals.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








##### How are you different from other Cabinets marketing + lead generation companies?
We say usually 3-6 months to see upward trajectory in links, keywords, and traffic – and 6-9 months for more obvious ROI on increase in leads and closed business. It definitely helps if you already have traffic on your website, and have a domain over a year old.
  * We use our Search Engine Optimization tools to find more opportunities for your company by analyzing your site’s analytics.
  * We then take action and write landing pages and posts that will earn links back to you from other websites.
  * We meet on a monthly basis to report on the results that we are getting and what the game plan will be for the upcoming month.


##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

## Get more leads with a Cabinets Website Design that people can trust
When it comes to purchasing something, whether it be a good or a service, people are more likely to buy from someone that they can trust. That is why having a website that shows things like trust factors, examples of your recent work, and just having a modern and up to date site that people can navigate on is so important.

##### How long does it take for SEO to get results?
SEO is not something that takes off overnight – it is actually a process that takes around 3 to 6 months to see clear results so you see that things are working well. There will be another stage at the 6 to 9-month mark where you will see your ROI to be seen and will also have a pretty sizable increase in the number of leads you have.
Our home services web design process generally takes around 100 days to get a fully-custom website you love, designed from scratch and developed by hand, from expert WordPress web developers.
1. We kickoff and extract all the awesome things about your company from you (2 hours tops for the kickoff)
2. Then we design (from scratch) and present it to you. We get feedback from you (the main big pieces of feedback first, and then more granularly in a super easy to use platform called Invision that allows you to comment on the design.)
3. Once we incorporate your feedback in a few rounds of revisions – and you love your website design… we develop that website from scratch in WordPress so it’s easy too edit content, on the backside of your website.
4. We do a 3-part ‘quality assurance’ internally, work with you to get content, and then we launch the website, and make sure everything is in tip-top shape with our launch checklist.
5. We can work with you on SEO if you want!
These days, many of the searches that are being done are coming from things such as mobile devices and tablets. Right around 50 percent to be precise.
This means that if you don’t have a mobile-friendly device, you could be missing out on 50 percent of the potential customers that are out there because they aren’t able to navigate your site.
Our website design always makes this a priority because we know how important it is.

Elements of color are essential not only in the way they pair with other complementary shades but also in the quantity and placement in relationship to those other colors and in how it relates to other patterns and photographic elements next to it and elsewhere on the website. In this section, I will share/curate websites with beautiful color schemes, hexadecimal codes, and just a brief note about why color being used works in context as well.
#b11a21 – In an overlay, juxtaposed against flat blue, the photographic background gives depth.
#e0474c – The smiling face coming through the red, makes it feel striking.
#7acfd6 – The flat blue provides a contrast to the photo behind the red. 
#f1f0ee – Simple light grey is used to provide depth behind a later photographic section, with white below.
#CAE4DB – Never underestimate a color palette created by a photograph to set the tone of your design.
#DCAE1D – In this case, the palette is set with the photo and then echoed in the subtitle.
#00303F – Cerulean is incredibly classy as a black or dark grey alternative if used consistently throughout.
#7A9D96 – This clean, natural color is established in the photo but could be used on a lower full-width block or buttons as well.
#393939 – Dark designs take a little bit more fore-thought but can provide tons of contrast if used well. 
#FF5A09 – With different shades of oranges, there is depth and gradient, without venturing into totally new colors. 
#ec7f37 – Utilizing illustrative elements, requires a bit of flexibility for the natural lightness and darkness to contour objects. 
#be4f0c – Using on color over on the color wheel can keep the palette looking classy, bold, and restrained.
#4ABDAC – Once again the color overlaid over the photographic elements provides a classy modern touch
#FC4A1A – A figure in the foreground is worked into the context, still paying attention to how it complements the overall structure of the design. In fact, one might even be able to surmise that the design was down around this figure. 
#F7B733 – The Yellow provides only a juxtaposed call to action and highlights important parts
#DFDCE3 – Clean grey, utilized in the photograph, keeps the structure un-encumbered by more colors or patterns in these sharp headshots.
#368cbf – Blue wins for trust in color psychology, but make sure it’s a tasteful hue, as some blues are too out of the box. Just like my art teacher said with paints, you should always mix them before applying to canvas, lest you get something that looks like you just slapped the colors out of the box. 
#7ebc59 – Corporate Blue + Eco-conscious green = Every website ever. But don’t overlook the use of common color schemes just because their common. Wield familiar colors together when it serves your purpose of feeling trustworthy. 
#33363b – Breaking up white space with a darker header, footer, or full-width sections provides relief from things that are too repetitive. 
#eaeaea – This truly is one of the most common color schemes around the website, particularly for technology companies. Are you sick of it yet? I like it.
**The vital part of this section is a reminder that colors don’t live in a vacuum.** How they relate to each other is complex, and pairing them not only with other colors that complement them but in degrees and quantities that work well together is important. When I show that orange and yellow are working well together, always keep in mind the context and how much of each are present. There might be a tiny sliver of yellow, so it’s not just that they work well, but how much of each and where.
Taking color out of the mix entirely – for certain parts of a website – or composition, in general, can be a classy yet straightforward way to increase the seriousness, or elevate the intensity of a piece. This is evidenced by how we feel when we see a black and white photo; either we sense certain self-importance or appreciate the simplicity and recognize an air of positive sophistication.
This concept and tone are also present in websites where only one color and various hues of that color are used, allowing the eyes to rest and revel in all that is blue, or all that is green, or 3 shades of purple. **I will also include some monochromatic + 1 color schemes** which mean black, white, any shades of gray plus one other color, and it’s shaded. The same general principles are at play in each of these scenarios. By eliminating all other colors except a select few, you can actually enhance the way the few remaining colors play together and increase the dramatic tension of the website – if it’s done well.
In the end – the website design alone won’t sell more stuff if that’s your goal. Combine these high-end styles with Search Engine Optimization to get more leads.
#262626 – Repeat after me, all grays are not equal

This color scheme, of course, also demonstrates what a great photo can do for the overall look of your site if juxtaposed with the strong contrast of the flat color elements.
#201d3a – Not quite B&W+1 – Hint of purple in the corner of the photograph
**And a couple more greyscale websites to make it abundantly clear that greyscale can be extremely beautiful.**
This whole section calls to mind how much we overlook the use of negative space in design and rely instead on our ability to fill space. Leaving white space and filling only a portion of it intentionally establishes a sophistication in design, and now crowded frills can beat. Pair this sensibility with a tasteful choice of typographic elements and well-crafted photographic assets to make anything look high-end.
Typography, color, layout. None of these elements stand alone in any composition, and to talk about one without the other leaves an incomplete picture. Always be paying attention to how the character of your plays with your typographical elements. should be hand-selected for their attributes, not selected haphazardly.
by , Available on MyFonts – By taking the high-end feeling gold gradient and pairing it with very intentional shaped typographic elements, the designers of this site juxtaposed the rugged and elegant.
– Available through – Looks gorgeous as a testimonial or call out quote.

– is as classic as it is simple. Common similar like Gotham Black, Montserrat, or Proxima Nova can allow you a similar but different flavor. Still, Futura Bold will be useful for a lot of situations – and plays well in this simple red, gray, tan color scheme as uppercase titles.
– As both the 100 weight in the blockquote above and the paragraph text (font-weight: 400), Museo Slab provides readability, whether big and small. Futura, Museo Slab over these comfortably simple colors feel not necessarily classic, but modern and original. The restraint in both color choices and typography leads to a very cohesive feel that leaves the whole website feeling integrated and branded.
– I love the look that many modern European websites achieve with this mature, swiss feeling typeface. It’s going to see a lot more use in America before it gets overdone here. The no-frills application below shows you the confidence with which a lot of European designers are using it. Impeccably played.
No matter what colors you use, your website will be better if it uses a very well thought out typeface or two. Finding a balance between the color and the fonts is not necessarily scientific – it requires a certain poetic association, but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely subjective. The colors can either be diametrically opposed to the personality/personalities of the typeface(s), or be in direct alignment with them.
**Using descriptive words like ‘masculine,’ ‘feminine,’ ‘rugged,’ ‘classic,’ ‘clean,’ ‘modern,’ and ‘expressive,’ can help you talk about color schemes and typefaces with your clients and others working on your design with you.** It’s important not to get caught up in the semantics – or meanings of the words – too strictly. Rather, use them as they are useful to you and discard them as soon as they become contentious.
The crucial piece is that your designs serve the purpose that they are intended for – . By taking some time to start projects with a color scheme that meets the emotional needs of the prime demographic, you are setting them up for success. At it’s most basic level, that means not making a website for men purple as it’s statistically their least preferred color. You also wouldn’t want to make a medical website black as it connotates death, or giving a very light and airy yellow color scheme for a serious subject lest it insinuates frivolity. 
At it’s most acute, intention in a means communicating the brand voice, the emotional appeal, occasionally being open to things previously learned by others (green for an environmental project, blue for a technology project, red for sports and aggression,) and following your instinct as you dive headfirst into what would truly speak to this particular market. The greatest designers were all guessing, too, and took a stab at something new. Jump in, soak up what’s already out there in the particular market the product or service is in. Then, look at the most visually appealing and effective designs in all markets and try your hand. After you’ve tried some pre-mixed hex color schemes listed above or elsewhere – mix up your own.
[bctt tweet=”“The greatest designers were all guessing too and took a stab at something new.””]
**Recognize your hidden powers, trust your creative instincts, and get your hands dirty.**
Well, I’ll tell you one thing a modern color palette is not using super simple versions of the colors we traditionally think of: blue, green, yellow, etc. Regardless of if you can make simple colors look good together or not – it seems unsophisticated and relatively bland. I remember my painting teacher in college saying always to mix your paints with intention at the beginning of a session – because people who just squeeze them out of a tube are going to find the look of their painting drab indeed.
**What we want is a modern color palette that appeals to the refined tastes of today’s consumer. It can be bold and fresh, or earthy and rusty – but it should never look haphazard.**
There are obviously a lot of choices to choose from when it comes to the colors you choose for your website. Lucky for you, some great online color scheme generators can help you find the perfect fit for you.
With an easy click-to-copy feature, you can paste the HEX codes the existing color schemes they already have available.
With the option to choose from complementary, analogous, triad, split-compliment, and square color combinations, this fun tool allows you to explore numerous color options and helpful images below the color wheel to help you visualize each color combo.
If you want to get extremely detail-oriented with your color schemes, then check out the Cooler app, which allows you to get very technical with your colors for a highly-customizable web color scheme.
The Palette Generator is an awesome way to help turn your favorite landscape, cityscape, or any photo into a color scheme. Easily upload a picture, and this tool does the rest.
Another tool that allows for highly customizable colors; Paletton is a great app for expanding your color scheme repertoire.

Blue is definitely the safest choice since it has the highest number of people saying it’s there favorite at 35%. However – clearly, if your competitors are all using blue, it might make sense to ‘differentiate’ your offering and brand. Your brand colors should be appealing, and ‘white space’ is an important part of that. Make sure you give space to the elements you do include, have a contrast between text and backgrounds, and don’t overwhelm the visitor – trying to be too flashy or being novel just for the sake of novelty.
Consider that 51% of brands choose monochrome logos, 39% use two colors, and only 19% of companies choose full-color logos. Besides photographs, 1, 2, and 3 color websites seem to be easier to pull off well than trying to make a website with a rainbow of colors. That being said – if you have a professional designer, clearly Microsoft and Google believe there’s a benefit of working with more colors as they both use at least 4 solid colors in their design.
Choosing a color scheme is tricky – but there are far more heavy-duty problems in a website design that may benefit from the help of a seasoned designer. Professional web designers have tried 100’s of things and realized what methods do and don’t work – ideally, if you work with a team like Hook Agency they’ve also A/B tested websites, made changes based on Analytics, and know how to make your website easy to find on Google.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.
##### Do you help with making sure the website ‘converts’ traffic too?
We use a custom dashboard for your business to monitor our success, and the dashboard focuses on our next steps, and **the actual amount of contact form submissions, phone calls or e-commerce sales** that a client receives for the month.
We love helping clients determine what a lead from their website is worth so there is accountability, transparency, and understanding of the R.O.I. that comes from our services. We insist on this and we thrive off of it. It’s not uncommon for companies to come away from the first couple months working with us with a much deeper understanding of how their website converts visitors into leads and what that means for their bottom line. We love this – and learn a ton from each of our clients as well.
We love working with smart entrepreneurs, small business owners, and marketing directors – and would love an opportunity to chat with you about your business and what could do for you. Contact us now.
Each ‘Content Management System’ is like a type of car – you wouldn’t try to buy a Toyota from a Porsche dealership. requires some specialization as well – and we’ve worked on for many years now, learning the ins and outs of it while finding ways to be more efficient than my competitors. I’ve seen people sell a client Magento (a content management system) because they knew they could get a better margin on it – **even when the client could’ve had an extremely effective website with WordPress + WooCommerce**. I honestly want you to have a website you can make changes on yourself and get the most effective solution for a reasonable price.

helps businesses by allowing them to attract more customers to their website and if it’s done right – attract them in a way that they also become customers. This is why we pair with ‘Conversion Rate Optimization’ so that any site we’re doing on also gets improvements in design and development that are intended to make it easy for people to become customers of your business.
You don’t want to just attract people to your site, you want them to take the next steps towards becoming a customer. Your website needs to be compelling and be set up for maximum conversions so that you can get the most out of our Minneapolis services.
To rank for these keywords, we will use both on-page and off-page tactics to optimize your website for the keywords that you want to try and rank for.
On-page SEO is characterized by the content of your web pages and the overall structure of the website. Both of these factors will impact how Google crawls your site and what keywords it thinks that you should rank for.
Our goal with on-page SEO is first and foremost to create quality content that will solve user’s problems and therefore bring value to the internet. However, we also recognize that the search engines are robots and that means that we need to give them hints to explain the context of the page to them.
To do this, we use keywords, the phrases that you want to rank for, in the content. These keywords are extraordinarily powerful in your title, header tags, and meta information.
The search engines crawler will read that information and understand the content on the page, making it more likely that you will rank for those keywords. As well as improving the content on your pages we also work on the overall structure of your website.
The base structure of a website is critical for SEO, and that’s why it’s a great idea to hire the same company to design your site as well as to manage your SEO.
Off-page SEO boils down to getting more links from quality websites pointing back to the pages that you want to rank. To acquire these links, we will perform legitimate digital marketing techniques to give your site publicity.
By ranking higher in the search engine results pages, you should be able to bring in more significant quantities of traffic and a higher quality of traffic that is more likely to convert.
Overall, digital marketing means more people on your website and therefore more opportunities for you to sell to that traffic and to convert them into paying customers. At the very least you would hope to encourage them to sign up to your email list, where you can market to them again.
Search Engine Optimization is about getting your website higher on Google. We help make tweaks to your website, create content on your behalf, and get links back to your website from around the web. These are the things that Google’s algorithm is looking for – and we know how to turn that traffic into leads.

## Commercial Roofing PPC that’s built for you and your business
One reason we’re wildly different than so many of our commercial roofing PPC competitors – is that they don’t have designers and developers on staff.
So many of the things that get results in Google ads – are actually not the Google ads themselves.
They’re where you send the CLICK. Your website, or landing page.
Having people on staff that handle that, and handle that well – so it matches what is being said in the ad and smoothly converts the visitor to a customer – is the real magic.
We know what it takes to attract Commercial Roofing leads with Google ads, and can do that for you.






We see company’s doing commercial roofing PPC that know how to spend money quick and in-efficiently. We pride our selves on a slower approach, building up what’s working, and trimming negative keywords that don’t make you money. We may not spend 10k the first month, but we also make sure your spending is much more targeted than many who may be more reckless.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
Visual/display ad design is part of the initial fees on your PPC campaign. We have the staff to help you with this and are willing to price them efficiently as part of an initial project or down the road. Be confident knowing that all of our skills are in-house and ready to help at any time. Including coders, designers, writers, and SEO specialists + along with your Roofing PPC / Google ad specialists that will be running your campaigns.
We start at $2k for any spend under $5k in budget, and it scales up slowly from there for higher spends. We try to be extremely reasonable in our pricing, and it includes setup and monthly reporting. We are open to reporting more often at the beginning of our services, but in general after the first few months – we find it makes sense to share key findings and changes in a monthly call.

## Commercial Roofing SEO Systems to Turn Your Website into a Lead Magnet
Search Engine Optimization or SEO for short is the process of building content out on your site to attract more searches for specific searches – making technical changes, and getting links (huge for Google visibility.) Now – what are people searching related to Commercial Roofing?
  * We then build out content and use the code on your website to better target the terms.


We love chatting with companies about their online marketing goals. We’d love to talk to you whether or not we’re the right fit, and we’re super honest about the effort it takes and whether or not we can meet or exceed your expectations.
  * We help do research online about what the most Googled terms are related to commercial roofing in your area.
  * We’ll help you build out content and pages on your site to attract more clicks from searches for money-making keywords.
  * We’ll continually monitor, improve, and report on wins and talk through leads with you on a monthly basis.


**Here’s a client result – we helped them rank nationally for ‘Commercial Roof Replacement’:**






And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
Search Engine Optimization is about getting your website higher on Google. We help make tweaks to your website, create content on your behalf, and get links back to your website from around the web. These are the things that Google’s algorithm is looking for – and we know how to turn that traffic into leads.
##### How do your roofing SEO services get me more leads?
These marketing techniques are designed to get your website featured around the internet using articles that will link back to the pages that you want to rank.
These links signal to Google that your page is popular and credible, encouraging them to rank it higher in the results pages. Our services often double our client’s website traffic and leads – we can share with you our exact methods, send us a message now!
When I was a web designer at another marketing agency, a woman worked with me – she referred me to her roofer friend who needed a website.
We launched a pretty cool website, I also happened to get a 20k promotion at the job – but I didn’t love it.
I wanted our clients to respect us, and I want to get more specialized (we did everything for everyone.)
And so… when I went out on my own, I started getting more construction and home services clients, particularly roofers.
Roofers now make up over a third of clients, and our biggest specialty is getting them higher on Google.
So you could say SEO for roofing companies is the top specialty for our 28-person team.

### A CONCRETE AND HARDSCAPING SEO STRATEGY TESTED AND PROVEN TO GENERATE MORE LEADS
We kick off our SEO process by sitting down with you to gain an understanding of your business, its goals, and its ideal customers. We then spend time brainstorming different keywords that your potential clients are searching for in order to create content on your behalf that answers any questions they may have. By enhancing your online presence with this optimized content, we help Google recognize your website as a thought leader in your industry.
Our work continues with consistent technical tweaks on your website and backlinks from other authoritative sites in your niche. You’ll always be able to keep track of your progress and results with a live analytics dashboard and monthly reporting calls with one of our specialists.
We only want to do what is best for your company. That’s why we have taken the time to perfect our strategy that actually works to bring more traction to your site on a long-term basis.






##### What are your top SEO strategies for Concrete and Hardscaping Businesses?
We believe SEO doesn’t live in a bubble. That’s why unlike many Cabinets SEO companies we make ‘Conversion Rate Optimization’ tweaks like adding call-to-actions and trust factors like testimonials in key places to increase your conversion rate.
  1. Looking at competitors’ websites and finding out what they’re ranking for, and then having writers create pages targeted at those topics, with a form at the top, or inviting new customers at the bottom of articles.
  2. Creating links back to the site by ‘guest posting’ on other Cabinets-related websites.
  3. Creating on-page targeting through meta titles and descriptions. We use Ahrefs to find out what terms people are searching the most, and target pages at those. We also make changes to your website structure so your website is easier to crawl (like de-indexing thin, and duplicate content – HUGE!)


##### Why should I trust your Concrete and Hardscaping SEO process?
We have 160+ 5-star reviews, and an average of 82% more traffic for our clients. We’re always aiming to increase that and to turn every client into a case study.
We have been plugging away at our processes for years and are always changing and adapting to changes to the necessary changes that are coming as time moves on.
We love working with our clients and our clients love working with us. Hopefully, we get the opportunity to build a relationship with you and get your business the leads you’re looking for.
Search Engine Optimization is about getting your website higher on Google. We help make tweaks to your website, create content on your behalf, and get links back to your website from around the web. These are the things that Google’s algorithm is looking for – and we know how to turn that traffic into leads.

  * We know how to make trustworthy sites, and trust is the #1 ingredient you need for more leads. 
  * You want your site to rank on Google – and we build in the components needed for that. 
  * We focus on the persuasiveness and the ‘conversion focus’ of your site to drive maximum leads. 


We have monitored the analytics on 100’s of contractors websites and know what drives people to take action. We build in trust factors, and persuasive images and headlines to drive leads.
Where website design + combine to bring in the right people right when they’re searching. That’s our speciality – we build the site with SEO in mind from the beginning.
We know some people don’t read. We skip to the point right when they land on the website to give them a reason to contact you right away, or at least let them know the point of the website from the outset.
People make split decisions about who they are going to contact – yes, even in commercial roofing projects. They make those decisions by reviews, and… your website.
  * If those potential customers can’t find you on the internet or they are turned off by your website, you’re throwing away thousands of dollars in possible leads each month.
  * Making an actually persuasive site is near impossible for the uninitiated. People that do this internally or through a cheap resource, often end up with more headaches and less leads. 
  * That’s where we come in. By getting in touch with us we are confident that we can create a website for you that will represent your brand effectively, help to bring in more commercial roofing leads each month and translate to higher profits.

Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.
We have a process that takes around 100 days from start to finish. However, this is not always an exact timeframe because like everything, things change and people need to adjust.
When you go from a crappy old website that isn’t functional, looks bad, and doesn’t make it clear as to where you should be going to make a purchase, then yes, a new website definitely will benefit your business and get you more leads if you have the traffic coming onto your site.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
We take the time to get to know your company and industry so that we can create a keyword strategy that targets the people already looking for your services. But it doesn’t just stop there. Our team continues to track your results and make any necessary tweaks to your campaign so that you can make the most out of your advertising budget.
Our approach focuses on seeing what works and cutting out the parts that could be performing better. And with compelling copy and creative design, our display ads get people to click when you want them to.
Here at Hook, we don’t like to waste time, and we definitely don’t like to waste money, so you can rest assured that we’ll create campaigns tailor-made with your business in mind. We’ll help to stretch your budget further and take Google Ads management off your plate so that you can focus on running your business day-to-day.






If you’ve ever tried PPC but didn’t get the results you were hoping for, we definitely understand. It can be tough to strategize, especially if you don’t know what you’re doing or how you can maximize your efforts.
We take the time to steadily attract the right customers and make sure that your money is being used in the right places giving you the best results for your dollar.
A lot of people will go with the “all-in” approach, which does not necessarily give you the results you want, and could be a giant waste of money if it doesn’t work out. We find what’s working and what isn’t and expand on the parts that are working for your business goals.
We see company’s doing PPC that know how to spend money quick and in-efficiently. We pride our selves on a slower approach, building up what’s working, and trimming negative keywords that don’t make you money. We may not spend 10k the first month, but we also make sure your spending is much more targeted than many who may be more reckless.
We start at $2k for any spend under $5k in budget, and it scales up slowly from there for higher spends. We try to be extremely reasonable in our pricing, and it includes setup and monthly reporting. We are open to reporting more often at the beginning of our services, but in general after the first few months – we find it makes sense to share key findings and changes in a monthly call.

We love working with contractors, and not only that, but we’re pretty dang good at what we do too! We have found over the years that we get the best results for the contractors that we work for and have limited our clients to make it strictly to work with them.
In our contractor website design, we kick things off with a meeting of your leadership for our 4 step simple discovery. We then identify your ideal customers and talk through trust factors like badges and reviews to make sure the site will be persuasive.
We start things off with a kickoff meeting where our first month includes finding keywords, local directory listings for initial link-building, and going over technical changes on the site. We will also report to you monthly and make the pivots based on the roadmap we set out in the first month.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
When visitors land on your website, you want to do whatever you can to make them stay. The longer your ideal customers stay on your website, the more likely they are to find the services they are looking for and possibly convert. Plus, it’s good for search engines to see that your website is filled with value.
Keep them on your site by including an engaging company video, reviews that highlight your amazing services, or even a meme that lightens the mood. You want your site visitors to trust you, root for your company, and even relate to you. That makes it easier for them to want to work with you.
Keeping people on your website sounds pretty straightforward, but it can be difficult to actually implement on your own. That’s where we come in! We’ll build you a custom site that’s built with in mind from the get-go. Our sites bring in more traffic and help you get the conversions that are vital to the success of your business.
##### How does Hook make the entire web design process simple and straightforward?
Transparency and communication are vital to the Hook Agency. From the very beginning, we engage in meaningful dialogue that uncovers the actual needs of your business. We ask the necessary questions to understand your clients and your company’s values fully.
Our team is there for you every step of the way, and we redefine what it means to exhibit reliable customer service. We keep you updated on our results and ongoing updates. We also educate you on meaningful strategies that can pay enormous dividends for your business.
This can change however depending on several factors such as the size of the site, or the involvement of the party getting the website.
Absolutely not! Have you ever heard the saying you get what you pay for? Because that saying stands true with solar website design.
When you go with the cheap route, you will get a website that is only going to last you 1, maybe two years, and be right back to where you started. These cheap sites are also not going to be as conversion-focused and won’t bring you the leads a more experienced and professional designer could.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
## Contractor PPC that will help to bring your business to the next level
When you own a business, you definitely have a lot of hats to wear and don’t always have time for important things like marketing and lead generation.
When this happens, you can easily find yourself in situations where you don’t have much business coming through or wondering where your next customer is going to come from
We want you to be able to assist your customers and make your mark o the world by improving the lives of others through your work and you deserve to do that.
If you want to get the most out of your marketing dollars then it is time to look towards the professionals who do this stuff on the daily and can make sure that your dollar is being pushed as far as it can.
## See how your company can benefit with more leads from Contractor PPC
Investing in your marketing can be something that can greatly help your business reach your target audience and get more leads, especially if you don’t know what you are doing.
When you don’t understand how paid ads work, you could just be throwing money around and not know if it’s working or not. We always make it a priority to know new and upcoming strategies and make education a big part of what we do to constantly improve our services.
We always take the time to get to know and understand your company and how it ticks so we know who your target market is, after all, that’s the most important part of this is understanding your customers and who they are.






SEO is still one of the best investments you can make in growing your business, but the use of PPC in tandem with a strong SEO strategy is almost unbeatable. If you have keywords where you don’t currently rank well organically, or if your category has low-search volume and needs to bring in users searching for adjacent keywords – PPC is an absolute necessity.
Driving users to your site through Google AdWords & Bing Ads creates a similar experience to organic search, users feel no less inclined to turn into customers simply because they clicked through an ad. They have demonstrated an intent to engage with a business like yours, using PPC means you can kickstart that engagement.
AdWords can be an expensive channel, especially in categories like law or construction – so you need a well-constructed approach. There is more than just an average CPC (Cost per click) to consider – you need to identify your website conversion rate, your target CPA (Cost per acquisition) and determine the CPC you can accept to make it all run. This is the simplest way to state it, but to make it work you need:
  * Bid position testing – test the right position to grab clicks and conversions
  * Utilize the search-terms report to identify new long-tail keywords and negative search terms to increase efficiency


Sound easy? It’s a time-consuming process. You can use averages as a starting point to determine the cost of traffic for your industry, but from there it can get complicated quick!
##### What’s the difference between SEM, PPC, Paid Search & SEO?
Depending on who you ask, SEM (Search Engine Marketing) is either a synonym for PPC/Paid Search, or is an over-arching term for any marketing done in search engines – organic or paid. Beyond that, PPC/Paid Search/SEM can all be used interchangeably – they all typically refer to using paid ads in a search engine. SEO is all about generating traffic organically, using a combination of Content & Technical SEO tactics to increase your SERP ranking.
Although they are managed in the same advertising platform, Facebook Ads Manager, they have pretty unique characteristics.
Facebook is considered to have an older audience, which is true, but this is a little bit deceptive. Most people between 18-29 (88%) use Facebook, they just have a tendency to use it less – and they also use Instagram (59%). Whereas 79% and 61% of 30-49 year olds & 50-54 year olds use Facebook – but only 31% & 13% use Instagram. You’re getting good audience penetration using just Facebook, but if you want to capture and hold the attention of a larger audience under 29 you need to be in both platforms.
Facebook allows us to use lead ads and has multiple placements in the news feed and right-column, ads are 1200×628. You can use static or video ads, as well as carousel (series of slides), canvas (expandable mobile experience), or collections (an ad with multiple products showcased below it).
In Instagram we can place ads in feed, static or video, ads are 1080×1080 – and we can use Instagram Stories ads shot 9:16. There are no lead ads, but we can still drive traffic to your site to create leads and sales.
Excellent question! Utilizing both is an ideal scenario, as you are reaching two totally different audiences. Bing searchers typically stick to Bing, as do Googlers – so utilizing both ad channels is the best way to reach your entire audience. The synopsis of both channels is as follows:
Google: Contains the vast majority of search volume, highly competitive (more search volume, but higher CPCs) and highly relevant traffic. Tends to skew younger, more tech-savvy. Has a broader range of tools to provide advertisers.
Bing Ads: Runner-up in the world of search engines, skews slightly older – primarily utilized by Windows users who are comfortable with the default experience or utilize the built in Windows 10 search bar (powered by Bing). Volume is much lower in Bing, but traffic is more cost-effective.
AdWords allows us to serve display, or text, ads on a huge variety of websites – these sites opt-in to the AdSense network and allow us to show ads for prospecting (interest, demographic, topic, affinity audiences, etc) purposes or retargeting (previous visitors to your website). Google has given us a really great tool for creating awareness & although it has a much lower conversion rate than search advertising – it can be an effective tool.
It’s complex, and is something of a black-box in terms of how properties are valued, but the simple answer is that the historical performance of your ads, the relevance of your ad to the keyword being searched, the quality of your landing page, and your bid are matched in an auction against other businesses. If you are winning in the categories outside of bid you are given a significant advantage, and will have what is called a higher Quality Score, this means you will need to bid less to earn the same position. You will pay the lowest possible amount per click to attain the position above the next business in line.
Ex. If all factors are equal, but you bid $1 and a competitor bids $.75, you will pay $.76.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
### Contractor SEO that is fully dedicated to bringing you more leads and building up your business
When it comes to getting more leads, it is not only the number of leads you get that matters, but the number of qualified leads that you are actually able to sell to, otherwise, what’s the point?
During our contractor SEO process, we take the time to really get to know you and your business so we can find the right customers to target and focus on them with your SEO strategy.
With our services, we build out a content calendar that has the keywords that are centered towards your target audience so we can get these posts and pages to rank and get in front of them and actually get noticed and get them converted.
### SEO for contractors that understand how important ranking on Google is, to their business
Some people don’t think Google is very important to their contracting business. We don’t make our services for those people. They can buy $2,000 dollar SEO – and have someone outsource everything across the world.
**We’re a contractor SEO agency, for companies that are driven, and relentless around finding the best leads, with the best closing rates – that turn into profitable jobs and long-term referrers of their business.**
A contractor I was chatting with recently, told me a story of a very solid $200,000 job when the average job for what they do is $15,000. It was a multi-family unit – and he said they got the job from a referral.
I said… ‘Wait… don’t tell me just what I want to hear – but where did the original customer that referred that job to you come from?’
“Google Ads! Actually Skyler and I talked about that particular lead on one of our reports, before it closed.”
### Referrals are beautiful, but Google expands your network so you have more places to get referrals from.
  * Yes, sometimes you get several deals that close from Google ads, and boom it’s very clear that the profit from those jobs is 5x or 10x what you spent on the ads + management of those ads.
  * But also – you increase the ‘nodes’ in your network, beyond just word of mouth.


Leveraged right – Google ads, increases word of mouth. Of course, this hinges on your company being great at customer service, clearly communicating, and yes – even asking for referrals regularly.
When I started my business, I knew I wanted to specialize in something, and I went with WordPress and lead generation.
I was ranking #1 for ( Still trying a little bit, but not really) – and three of my first five recurring clients were contractors:


I learned I actually love talking to contractors and I love their vibe – in comparison to big, corporate companies or technology companies.
So I started to go after contractors more – and my business coach said I should NICHE full-time.
### Cut to 6 years later – and we don’t work with anyone besides contractors / home service businesses.
It’s now been over a year of CONTRACTORS ONLY, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve ever made as a business:
  * Our processes are improving constantly to serve a tight group of businesses.
  * It’s also easier for us to connect on a marketing + sales level.

It is anything that has to do with getting more website traffic from search engines – normally these days that means Google, as Google traffic accounts for 2/3rds of all search engine traffic on the internet.
SEO works through many different factors, but the top thee are:
  * By creating a structure of well organized and planned content, both Users and Google are able to navigate it better.
  * You are able to answer customer’s questions and give them information on subjects you are looking to rank for.
  * By earning more high-quality backlinks with authority that help your website that will get you more authority.


Any way of getting more customers to be aware of your company is important – particularly when they are looking for a product or service like yours. That is why search engine traffic is ideal. You can pay for ads at the top of search engine results and in various places on the web, but only 18% of clicks in search engines go to these ads because many customers are savvy enough to skip them.
They trust in the algorithm of Google to serve the best results towards the top of the ‘organic’ results, or the other results besides the ads – your job (or a professional experts’ job) is to make sure your website is seen as the best result. The top 3 results for any one term get the lion’s share of the clicks, and the first page is generally the cutoff point for any meaningful traffic for most terms besides high volume ones.
helps businesses by allowing them to attract more customers to their website and if it’s done right – attract them in a way that they also become customers. This is why we pair with ‘Conversion Rate Optimization’ so that any site we’re doing on also gets improvements in design and development that are intended to make it easy for people to become customers of your business.
You don’t want to just attract people to your site, you want them to take the next steps towards becoming a customer. Your website needs to be compelling and be set up for maximum conversions so that you can get the most out of our Minneapolis services.
##### What is the difference between SEO and paid Google advertisements?
Google advertisements will bring you fast results, but once you stop spending money, you will stop seeing results.
Sioux Falls SEO is able to get your company to rank higher in the search results even after you stop paying for it. It is a process that will keep your business on top of search engines for a longer period of time.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
You’re a hard-working service industry professional. Your day-to-day can be taxing and it’s difficult to get home at the end of the day just to start more work to ensure that you’ll have another job to complete after the current one has been completed.
Not to worry! We’ve got you covered. Our custom PPC services will help your business continue to generate leads without any outbound effort from you. You can sit back and watch as new leads for jobs specific to your services come rolling in.






While it is a tempting thought that throwing in lots of money really fast will get you really fast results, it is not always true. We like to take a slower approach to make sure you are getting in front of the right audience and get results.
We then trim off the parts that are not performing and expanding the areas that are performing well for your business. This gives you a truly customized campaign that benefits your company. This way, you are able to get the best results.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.
##### Does my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.

### Get a website that brings you more leads through a conversion-focused Contractor website design
When it comes to having a website, that is only the first step. There are many things that help to make it more likely for you to get more leads and get people to convert on your site.
Having a website that builds trust is essential which is where trust factors like testimonials and partnerships are on the website so that people can see the experiences that others have had while working with you and really feel more comfortable with using your services.
When people are more comfortable with your business, they are more likely to work with you which is why we make it a priority in our website designs.
We also make sure the site is mobile friendly since a majority of searches are now coming from mobile devices. This means that having a mobile-friendly design will make it easier to navigate around your site.
Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
  * 90 Days – Development Review + Final Edits 100 Days- Launch








##### How long does a new website take to design and build?
A website can take anywhere from 2 months to 1 year, whereas the average process we work on with clients is 100 days – with time for a dedicated visual design process and iteration with feedback from the client, and a custom development process with time for iteration from the client, and content entry.
100 days from start to finish – We’re your Chicago web design partner that cares about getting it done right AND in a timely manner.
These days, many of the searches that are being done are coming from things such as mobile devices and tablets. Right around 50 percent to be precise.
This means that if you don’t have a mobile-friendly device, you could be missing out on 50 percent of the potential customers that are out there because they aren’t able to navigate your site.
Our website design always makes this a priority because we know how important it is.
Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.

So many business owners, and marketing managers have too many things on their plate to specialize in website design, SEO, PPC and all of the things that drive serious leads.
  * Paying for leads – can lead to an endless cycle of competition and lowering prices.
  * Low quality SEO providers scare most small businesses away from the real opportunity that exists when you have a team of real specialists.
  * Website edits, and content writing can take up too much of your time, not allowing you time for strategic work, and your other duties.


**That’s why our electrician marketing + electrician lead generation services are meant to service these exact problems,** by being diligent about monthly reporting, providing a marketing dashboard, and taking these things off your plate:
  * We strategize with you and download key info from your head.
  * We workshop that strategy with you, and then get to work diligently after revising.
  * We get links back to your website from other websites.
  * We have in-house writers who write useful content for your audience, and landing pages for money-making keywords.

##### How long does a new website take to design and build?
A website can take anywhere from 2 months to 1 year, whereas the average process we work on with clients is 100 days – with time for a dedicated visual design process and iteration with feedback from the client, and a custom development process with time for iteration from the client, and content entry.
100 days from start to finish – We’re your Chicago web design partner that cares about getting it done right AND in a timely manner.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.
We’re different than many electrician marketing companies in that we:
  * Are totally specialized in trying to get more leads from Google, rather than spreading ourselves thin on 10 different methods.
  * We utilize SEO + website design skills on every engagement, not just one or the other.

## ADS THAT ACTUALLY GET THE CLICK + LANDING PAGES THAT WIN THE BUSINESS
There are some really bad Fireplace PPC providers out there that don’t even know how to make new pages on your website, and that definitely don’t have 3+ web designers and developers on staff ready to create landing pages for each campaign that is lucrative for you.
We know what it takes to scale marketing campaigns that get massive results for our clients – and we LOVE working with roofers. You need more leads, in a scalable, efficient way that feeds your sales team and creates sustainable growth in revenue. We’re here to help.
We see company’s doing PPC that know how to spend money quick and in-efficiently. We pride our selves on a slower approach, building up what’s working, and trimming negative keywords that don’t make you money. We may not spend 10k the first month, but we also make sure your spending is much more targeted than many who may be more reckless.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
Visual/display ad design is part of the initial fees on your PPC campaign. We have the staff to help you with this and are willing to price them efficiently as part of an initial project or down the road. Be confident knowing that all of our skills are in-house and ready to help at any time. Including coders, designers, writers, and SEO specialists + along with your Roofing PPC / Google ad specialists that will be running your campaigns.
We start at $2k for any spend under $5k in budget, and it scales up slowly from there for higher spends. We try to be extremely reasonable in our pricing, and it includes setup and monthly reporting. We are open to reporting more often at the beginning of our services, but in general after the first few months – we find it makes sense to share key findings and changes in a monthly call.

When people come onto your website, they will instantly get a representation of who you are as a company.It’s important to have a website that is:
We have monitored the analytics on 100’s of contractors websites and know what drives people to take action. We build in trust factors, and persuasive images and headlines to drive leads.
Where website design + combine to bring in the right people right when they’re searching. That’s our speciality – we build the site with SEO in mind from the beginning.
We know some people don’t read. We skip to the point right when they land on the website to give them a reason to contact you right away, or at least let them know the point of the website from the outset.
Many websites are built simply to talk about the company and why they’re great. We challenge our clients to make their customers the hero of the story and put them at the forefront of the design.
At Hook Agency, we’re committed to making websites that not only look good, but actually get more leads and help more people.
  * Be laid out clearly and simply. Customers should have to search for the contact form or wonder what services you provide.
  * Provide specific next steps. Someone decides you’re the electrician for them – what’s next? What can they expect from your process? We strongly believe in the power of showcasing a clear and consistent process.
  * Be updated regularly. A stale and out-of-date website doesn’t put your company in the best light. It’s important to us that all of our clients feel comfortable using their website as a marketing tool, and can update it on a regular basis.

## Electrician website company that wants the best for you and your business
Growing a business can be tough. It can be even tougher when your business isn’t bringing in leads to help you grow you business.
You deserve to have a website that tells a story about who you are and why people should be choosing to work with you.
We want to help you tell that story and give you the best platform possible for your electrical company.
##### Do I Need to Hire an Electrician Website Design Company?
If you are first starting out and don’t have a big budget to spend, then yes, you shouldn’t be blowing all your money on a website and maybe defer to a cheaper freelancer or even building your own.
However, when you start to grow your business and are really starting to make a name for yourself, then that may be the right time to start thinking about getting a high quality and professionally done website.
It really depends on where you’re at as a company and if it makes sense financially for you to do.
We have a process that takes around 100 days from start to finish. However, this is not always an exact timeframe because like everything, things change and people need to adjust.
When you go from a crappy old website that isn’t functional, looks bad, and doesn’t make it clear as to where you should be going to make a purchase, then yes, a new website definitely will benefit your business and get you more leads if you have the traffic coming onto your site.

## Electrician SEO that is dedicated to bringing up the number of leads you get
If you have a business that you are looking to grow or make as profitable as possible, you are going to want to have a continuous amount of leads that are coming in.

## We use methods that work for our Electrician SEO services

Well.. to be fair, I believe if you engage an electrician marketing agency or freelancer, they should do their absolute best every time.
But often, their best is not enough. There is such a low barrier to entry in the marketing world, that your nephew who just graduated and took a Tai Lopez course on social media – may know to promise you ’15 more leads a month’ but might not be able to deliver.
## Choose a proven Electrician SEO agency that knows how to get leads
It doesn’t have to be Hook Agency – but choose a company with a track record for delivering more leads.
Literally – in one case, [we helped an electrical contractor get 383% more leads from Google organic traffic in less than one year](https://hookagency.com/our-work/electric-city/)!
  * Ideally, you might pair SEO with Google ads to increase leads quickly in months 1-2-3.
  * The website being persuasive matters a ton! So ideally, we’d also re-do your website to get the most out of your electrician seo services.
  * Next – power through with heavy-duty amounts of content, in the form of landing pages for niche services, location landing pages, and blog posts that service higher-funnel queries, and increase the overall footprint of the site to get more signals to Google your site is a resource that should be respected.


Ultimately, we want your website to have ridiculous amounts of traffic.
That’s not just because everything you rank for is going to bring in leads:
  * It helps get links from other websites, because people are more likely to link to helpful blog posts than service pages.
  * It creates contextual relevance, and ‘authority’ for certain topics – related to your services, that creates a kind of ‘osmosis’ effect that shares some of that authority and topical relevance to other more ‘money-making’ pages.
  * It is great for warming leads, and positioning yourself as a helpful company.


The whole purpose of creating electrical company website content, is to help humans. But by being helpful to humans, you also might just signal to Google that your website is the type of website that creates helpful content that services a need in the market.
Now – if that need your servicing in the market, also relates to the other pages you want to rank that target ‘Electrician in Your City’ – than over time you’ll see your rankings improve for those terms too, particularly if you have great inter-linking on your site and you’re starting to earn links from other websites as well.

Understanding the audience that you are trying to reach is critical in the marketing process because if you don’t know who you’re targeting then you’re just shooting in the dark towards your goals and are very unlikely to reach them. That’s why we take the time to go over with you what your target customer looks like so we can be sure to get the content that they are looking for.
Our website process is usually around a 100-day timeline that starts with a kickoff meeting that lets us get an understanding of your company and who your audience is. During this meeting, we ask the important questions that give us a better understanding so we can get you the most effective design possible. After that we move into the design process and where we design the site, go over the internal review, and then do our design presentation. When we get sign-off on the design, we move into the development of the website where we make it come to life. After this, we do the content entry and QA phases of the project before it is ready to launch.
##### How long does it take for you to get more leads?
When you start SEO, it is going to take a little bit of time for results to come, think around three to six months for you to start seeing your traffic number shoot up. Once you get to the six to nine-month mark you will see significant growth in traffic and leads that help to build your business.
PPC on the other hand will get you visibility right away, however, once you decide not to use these services, the results will no longer be there like they would with SEO.

## GET BIG RESULTS – BUILD YOUR BRAND AND YOUR CUSTOMER BASE
If your business has any marketing at all, it should be digital marketing. It is, simply put, the most efficient and cost-effective way for small and medium-sized companies to promote their business. Digital marketing allows you to leapfrog the competition and establish a brand without breaking the bank.
Digital marketing, when done right, offers real results. Little can build your brand more than developing an online presence. And, of course, it’s much easier for you to find potential customers when it’s easier for those customers to find you. Prioritizing SEO can be one of the most effective ways to promote and grow your small business.
But your area of expertise is fireplaces, not digital marketing. If you’re not going to do it right, the reality is marketing would be nothing but a waste of money. That’s where we come in. We can handle that side of things while you focus on delivering high-quality fireplace solutions.






SEO is a multi-faceted endeavor, which includes two main parts: on-page and off-page. On-page SEO refers to the structure and content of your website. Off-page SEO, on the other hand, includes other factors like the number of links to your site. Hook Agency takes a holistic approach that emphasizes both aspects.
##### How Does Fireplace Company SEO Help Me Get More Leads?
SEO helps you get more leads by allowing more prospective customers to find your business with greater ease. SEO techniques signal to Google that yours is a legitimate, popular site, which leads to Google ranking your website higher and making it much easier to find.
We are experts in SEO, and our techniques often double or triple the leads for fireplace companies. If you’re interested in learning more about our specific strategies, contact us now!
SEO is an essential aspect of marketing for a small business, but it is only one part of an overall marketing strategy. At Hook Agency, we divide marketing into two main components:
First, there is brand recognition. SEO plays an instrumental role here, but it isn’t enough. Make sure you have a sign on your building, wraps on your trucks, and do events out in the community as often as you can. The goal is to spread not only your logo but your presence and values.
Seeing your company’s logo spreads awareness that you exist; getting out in the community spreads awareness, and also a positive association with your brand in the minds of potential customers.
The other aspect is lead generation. That’s any effort designed to land you increased leads on a regular, reliable basis. You know that being highly featured on Google or HomeAdvisor is effective, but you need help scaling against your competition. That’s where we come in!
You’re an expert when it comes to fireplaces. We’re an expert when it comes to marketing and growing your business. Contact us now, and let us get to work for you!

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
The days of being able to compete in the fireplace industry without a top-quality, are long gone. Potential customers no longer check the yellow pages; they turn to search engines to find fireplace companies with whom to work. Even if they find your company, if your website looks basic and cheap, that will likely turn them off.
The fact is customers associate professional websites with professional service. No matter how good your work is, many possible leads will never give you a chance if you don’t have a site to match. And they’ll need to be able to find you in the first place; that requires high-quality Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Website design isn’t easy. You’re an expert in fireplace services, not web design or SEO. That’s where we come in. Hook Agency experts in these fields. And we’re looking to partner with growth-oriented fireplace companies who are looking to take the next step in their development as a business.
Reach out to us, and we’ll help you determine your next steps forward. If you tell us your specific business objectives, we’ll develop a specific strategy to help you reach those objectives.
For any small or medium-sized business, digital marketing is the best marketing. It’s effective and cost-efficient, and it delivers real results. Digital marketing is hands down, the best way for you to leap past the competition without breaking the bank or resorting to gimmicks.
A strong digital marketing presence is an intricate, in-depth process, but it requires two main aspects, without which there is no hope for success. You need a professional website, and you need strong SEO. SEO is what causes your site to rank highly on Google and other search engines, and allows customers to find your website. It doesn’t matter how beautiful your site is if no one can find it!
SEO is all about understanding and utilizing the keywords that will get your website ranked—the specific short and prospective leads will use to try to find a fireplace company in their area. It’s also about finding ways to link back to your sites from elsewhere on the web.
All that may sound simple, but it’s actually a complex science—one that we’ve been doing successfully for years. Hook Agency has helped lots of fireplace companies crush it on the web, and we want to help you too. Contact us today, and we’ll get to work developing a strategy to help you take your business to the next level.
##### Do I Need to Hire a Professional Company to Design my Fireplace Website
You certainly could try to design a website by yourself—all the tools are out there. But it’s a complicated process, and one that would take up hundreds of hours of your time, just to still fall short of professional quality.
No matter how hard we tried, we could never install a fireplace to the degree fireplace of even remotely the same quality you could. That’s simply not our area of expertise. Our area of expertise is building and advertising a website. Let our team of dedicated professionals take on that task, and so you can focus on doing what you do best.
If you understand that PROFESSIONALISM is important, and people really do care about the quality of your service…
We know how to help people trust you on your website, and we’d love to share with you our strategies.
A website can cost as low as 2k (for a non-professional using Squarespace or a WordPress theme) and up to 100k+ (for bigger marketing agencies) – but we tend to work with companies that have budgets for 10k+ up to 30k, and yearly budgets for our recurring clients of 20k+ up to 100k. We work with companies that stand to make significant money from telling their story well, and understand that this all-important aspect of their marketing is important.
If you understand that doing your marketing well can create significant value for you and your company, start the conversation now!
Of course, you wouldn’t pay for this service if it wasn’t really going to make a difference for your business. But we are confident that our strategies get results; we’ve been doing this for years, and we’ve seen fireplace companies double or even triple their leads time and time again.

  * The businesses that we work with are in the construction and home services industries
  * We work hard for your business compared to the others out there, in fact, we get more done in the first 3-6 months than other marketing companies will in a year.
  * Our 55+ five-star reviews from Google to go along with our many case studies that have been done with marketing campaigns we have done.


##### Why are you specialized in the Flooring + home services industries?
Working with clients in this space is something that we not only love, but something that we are very good at. We have found the best methods and practices to increase leads for our clients and always looking to learn and improve our works because we believe you can always work to get better. Whether it be through SEO and Paid ads or a new website design, our digital marketing services are sure to help your business get more leads and traffic to your site.
##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.

##### Do I Need to Hire an Flooring Website Design Company?
If you are first starting out and don’t have a big budget to spend, then yes, you shouldn’t be blowing all your money on a website and maybe defer to a cheaper freelancer or even building your own.
However, when you start to grow your business and are really starting to make a name for yourself, then that may be the right time to start thinking about getting a high-quality and professionally done website.
It really depends on where you’re at as a company and if it makes sense financially for you to do.
##### How are you different from other Flooring marketing + lead generation companies that are out there?
  * The businesses that we work with are in the construction and home services industries
  * We work hard for your business compared to the others out there, in fact, we get more done in the first 3-6 months than other marketing companies will in a year.
  * Our 55+ five-star reviews from Google to go along with our many case studies that have been done with marketing campaigns we have done.


Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
##### Am I at a point where SEO is worth it, and I should hire an agency?
This decision is entirely up to you. It does depend on your flexibility, motivation to learn, and the depth of your website Backed by your research, you could implement basic SEO strategies yourself. But you could also uncover a powerful strategy with the help of an expert.

"Our company was working with a different marketing agency for a couple years, before making the decision to switch. Hook built us a beautiful new website and is running our SEO & Google Ads.

"Hook Agency is the epitome of professionalism in a marketing agency. I own an 8 figure roofing business and marketing is one of the most vital parts to my business.

Can’t say enough good things, this is a premier marketing company who gets it right where few do!"
"Hook has been an excellent partner for Aquarius.

"Hook has been an absolute game-changer for our business! Their marketing team combines creativity with strategic thinking, resulting in campaigns that truly resonate with our audience.

##### What makes you different from other Garage Construction marketing companies?
We take the time to really get to know your company and who your target audience is so we can be sure to target them and bring them onto your site. We find the keywords that they are searching for and the ones that your competition is ranking for then go in and take those keywords so you can rank higher on Google so you can get more of the leads that you’re looking for.
We have a 100-day timeline for our websites. During this timeline, we start our process with a kickoff meeting then head into the design process. In the design process, we go over internal revisions and then have a design presentation of the site to the client. When the client approves the design, we do a design sign-off and move into the development phase of the site which is then followed up by a QA of the website and content entry of the site.
##### How long does it take for SEO to get results?
SEO is not something that takes off overnight – it is actually a process that takes around 3 to 6 months to see clear results so you see that things are working well. There will be another stage at the 6 to 9-month mark where you will see your ROI to be seen and will also have a pretty sizable increase in the number of leads you have.

## GARAGE CONSTRUCTION SEO STRATEGIES BUILT TO GET MORE EYES ON YOUR WEBSITE
Our strategy here at Hook is to inject your website with the high-value keywords and links that search engines love. Our SEO strategists and skilled writers take the keywords that your audience is searching for and create content that will satisfy their queries. Once Google finds that your site provides value to the people that need it the most, it will begin to show your site to even more people which is one of the main ways you get more leads.
We value creating healthy relationships with our clients, and we have found the best way to do that is to not waste their time with unnecessary efforts. From the beginning, we meet with our clients to determine their ideal audience and brainstorm ways to reach them in the most efficient ways. Our sole purpose is to grow your presence online and to position your brand in front of those that will earn your business more revenue.






We believe SEO doesn’t live in a bubble. That’s why, unlike many SEO companies, we make ‘Conversion Rate Optimization’ tweaks like adding call-to-actions and trust factors like testimonials in key places to increase your conversion rate.Other than that very important Garage Construction SEO Strategies include:1. Looking at competitors’ websites and finding out what they’re ranking for, and then having writers create pages targeted at those topics, with a form at the top, or inviting new customers at the bottom of articles.2. Creating links back to the site by ‘guest posting’ on other Garage Construction-related websites.3. Creating on-page targeting through meta titles and descriptions. We use Ahrefs to find out what terms people are searching the most, and target pages at those. We also make changes to your website structure so your website is easier to crawl (like de-indexing thin, and duplicate content – HUGE!)
We have 40+ reviews, and an average of 82% more traffic for our clients. We’re always aiming to increase that and to turn every client into a case study.We have been plugging away at our processes for years and are always changing and adapting to changes to the necessary changes that are coming as time moves on.We love working with our clients and our clients love working with us. Hopefully, we get the opportunity to build a relationship with you and get your business the leads you’re looking for.
Search Engine Optimization is about getting your website higher on Google. We help make tweaks to your website, create content on your behalf, and get links back to your website from around the web. These are the things that Google’s algorithm is looking for – and we know how to turn that traffic into leads.

## GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR ADVERTISING BUDGET WITH PPC EFFORTS THAT WORK
Don’t throw away money by working with other agencies that don’t care about your ROI. If your PPC campaigns are not attractive to your audience or not properly targeted, you could just be throwing money out the window.
Here at Hook, we put our clients first by making sure to create campaigns that are both visually appealing and optimized to convert. Through hours and hours of keyword research and copywriting, our PPC experts are equipped with the skills to make you ads that rise above the competition.
We love working with businesses like you because we know we can get results. We have found the best methods for this and are excited to see what we can do for you.






If you’ve ever tried PPC but didn’t get the results you were hoping for, we definitely understand. It can be tough to strategize, especially if you don’t know what you’re doing or how you can maximize your efforts.
We take the time to steadily attract the right customers and make sure that your money is being used in the right places giving you the best results for your dollar.
A lot of people will go with the “all-in” approach, which does not necessarily give you the results you want, and could be a giant waste of money if it doesn’t work out. We find what’s working and what isn’t and expand on the parts that are working for your business goals.
We see company’s doing PPC that know how to spend money quick and in-efficiently. We pride our selves on a slower approach, building up what’s working, and trimming negative keywords that don’t make you money. We may not spend 10k the first month, but we also make sure your spending is much more targeted than many who may be more reckless.
We start at $2k for any spend under $5k in budget, and it scales up slowly from there for higher spends. We try to be extremely reasonable in our pricing, and it includes setup and monthly reporting. We are open to reporting more often at the beginning of our services, but in general after the first few months – we find it makes sense to share key findings and changes in a monthly call.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.






Our top SEO strategies are the pillars of what we do to get you the best results possible and are always looking to improve and grow in our knowledge to make sure our results continue to improve. Some of our top strategies include the following:
1. Looking at competitors’ websites and finding out what they’re ranking for, and then having writers create pages targeted at those topics, with a form at the top, or inviting new customers at the bottom of articles.
2. Creating links back to the site by ‘guest posting’ on other Home Builders and home services-related websites.
3. Creating on-page targeting through meta titles and descriptions. We use Ahrefs to find out what terms people are searching the most, and target pages at those. We also make changes to your website structure so your website is easier to crawl (like de-indexing thin, and duplicate content – HUGE!)
##### What makes you different from other Home Builders marketing companies?
We know web design, and we know SEO and how to get your website more leads, but one of our biggest differentiators is the combination of those two to get you more leads than ones that just focus on one or the other.
  * We want you to be able to handle your “own your marketing”
  * We don’t trap you with long-term contracts – our services speak for themselves
  * You will get a live marketing dashboard + monthly reporting
  * We’re contractor focused and have our systems primed for these industries


These days, many of the searches that are being done are coming from things such as mobile devices and tablets. Right around 50 percent to be precise.
This means that if you don’t have a mobile-friendly device, you could be missing out on 50 percent of the potential customers that are out there because they aren’t able to navigate your site.
Our website design always makes this a priority because we know how important it is.

## GET A WEBSITE THAT REFLECTS THE QUALITY OF YOUR SERVICES
You have many options to choose from when it comes to building out your website. You could take on extra stress and try to build your own website using templates that are not tailored to your niche. You could work with freelance designers who may not have your business’s best interest at heart and are not necessarily specialized in working with Garage Constructors. You could even work with other marketing and design agencies that don’t know your industry.
You could work with a specialized team that is extremely well-versed in the contractor industry because that’s literally who they work with every day. Here at Hook, we only work with contractors and home service companies because we believe that you deserve an agency that is familiar with your business goals and objectives on a deeper level. So let us take things off your plate and build you a website that is clean, modern, and reflects the quality of your services.
  * We help build websites that help to bring in more leads each month which translates to higher profits.
  * We create websites with user experience at the forefront of the design. You want your visitors to actually enjoy using your website.
  * We’ll build you a site specifically designed to rank highly on Google using cutting-edge SEO practices.








This can change however depending on several factors such as the size of the site, or the involvement of the party getting the website.
##### Do I Need to Hire a Garage Construction Niched Website Design Company?
While you could choose to design a website yourself, without any technical expertise, it’s going to be a complicated process and one that will take up to hundreds of hours of your time. On the other hand, we have a team of dedicated professionals who can create a sophisticated website that would be too technical for you to create alone.
The structure of your website is incredibly important. Not only will it help visitors to navigate the site and discover your services, but it also helps you to rank higher in Google. And we know that Google has an overwhelming market share, with the majority of searches happening through their search engine.If you’re not ranking in Google for your chosen keywords, you’re leaving money on the table. That’s why we design our websites from the ground up with SEO in mind, to ensure that the on-page SEO forms a strong foundation for our future marketing efforts.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their roofing needs.
We are extremely honest, and practical – we can help direct you to another , that would be better if we aren’t the right fit.

"Hook Agency has been a pleasure to work with. Everyone that we work with is smart, focused and serious about their work. Hiring Hook has given me peace around our lead generation.

Thank you Vinny and thank you Hook Agency!"
Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








##### What makes you different from other Home Builders marketing companies?
We know web design, and we know SEO and how to get your website more leads, but one of our biggest differentiators is the combination of those two to get you more leads than ones that just focus on one or the other.
  * We want you to be able to handle your “own your marketing”
  * We don’t trap you with long-term contracts – our services speak for themselves
  * You will get a live marketing dashboard + monthly reporting
  * We’re contractor focused and have our systems primed for these industries


You may prefer to work with someone you can meet up with, and we’ve found that to be a great system for creating rapport, and the trust necessary to really deliver a great website based on your marketing goals. We think of your website as another salesman, and if you can hire another salesman to deliver great lead generation or more sales for you, then you’ve got a bargain.
**Web design and development in Minnesota means you get homegrown style**
We are not from California, nor the middle of Oregon so we’re not creating something that doesn’t match the cultural norms and expectations of your local community. We do have style that surpasses many agencies in town and the ability to execute on that. We’d love to work with you. If the type of work we do interests you and you would like to work together or sit down for some coffee, get a free consultation now.
##### Do we get regular reporting on our campaign’s progress? If so, how often?
Yes, transparency and communication are core to our business Hook Agency. We provide detailed, easy-to-understand reports on your campaign’s progress every month. These reports not only show you the metrics but also explain what they mean for your business – we also listen to calls and look at every form fill to only focus our conversations on real leads. Our goal is to keep you informed and confident that your marketing investment is driving results, but we tell it how it is if something is off, and don’t cover up problems but rather are aggressive to fix them. With our clear and consistent reporting, you can focus on what you do best – running your business – while we take care of your marketing.

For starters, if you have a home builders website design that is old and outdated, you’re going to have a tough time getting people to stay on your page and head straight to the competition that has a fresh and modern looking site that doesn’t look like it’s from the early 2000’s.

##### Do you only create websites that are backed by WordPress?
Our team wants to deliver a quality, SEO-friendly website to you and your business. To keep our process simple and effective, we lean on the WordPress platform because of its many benefits.
First, WordPress sites are the most mobile-friendly. When your website is optimized better for mobile, you will rank higher in the search results and gain more qualified leads. WordPress provides a variety of beautiful mobile-friendly web design templates that communicate your brand effectively.
WordPress also has systems in place to protect against the pains of hacking and cyber theft. Because of its useful plugins and cloud storage, you can back up your website content in a secure location.
When it comes to the various media types, WordPress websites can accommodate all. You can make your website as entertaining as possible. There are easy ways to embed Instagram photos, YouTube videos, Tweets, and Soundcloud audio clips by placing a URL in the editor fields.
Our home services web design process generally takes around 100 days to get a fully-custom website you love, designed from scratch and developed by hand, from expert WordPress web developers.
1. We kickoff and extract all the awesome things about your company from you (2 hours tops for the kickoff)
2. Then we design (from scratch) and present it to you. We get feedback from you (the main big pieces of feedback first, and then more granularly in a super easy to use platform called Invision that allows you to comment on the design.)
3. Once we incorporate your feedback in a few rounds of revisions – and you love your website design… we develop that website from scratch in WordPress so it’s easy too edit content, on the backside of your website.
4. We do a 3-part ‘quality assurance’ internally, work with you to get content, and then we launch the website, and make sure everything is in tip-top shape with our launch checklist.
5. We can work with you on SEO if you want!

Your website is the digital front door to your business—but if no one’s walking through, what’s the point of having a great-looking porch?
Search engine optimization (SEO) for home services is about way more than sprinkling in a few keywords—it’s a full-scale effort to raise your visibility on Google, build your online authority, and drive ready-to-buy homeowners straight to your site. It’s how local homeowners when they actually need you.
Let’s be blunt: if your website isn’t attracting high-quality traffic and converting it into real leads, it’s costing you money. And if you’re stuck on page two or buried beneath competitors, you’re invisible. That’s where we come in.
At Hook Agency, we specialize in helping home service companies—HVAC, plumbing, roofing, and more—rank higher and convert more. Our battle-tested SEO strategy is designed around the unique challenges and opportunities of the trades. We combine keyword research, content strategy, technical optimization, and high-authority link building to get your phones ringing and your team busy.
We’re not just doing this as a side hustle—we’re a Google-first agency that’s laser-focused on search engine dominance for home service companies.

Our entire playbook is built around how real homeowners search, click, and convert when they need urgent home services.
We live in this world. Every page we build, every blog we write, every technical tweak we make—it’s all with the homeowner in mind. We don’t chase shiny objects. We don’t hop between platforms or pivot with every marketing fad. We’re planted firmly where the highest intent lives: Google search.
No random industry detours into cafes, gyms, or SaaS startups.
We say no to anything that distracts us from helping the best home service businesses become #1 in their local market.
### We Say No So We Can Say Hell Yes to the Right Clients
We go all-in on what works for home services contractors—and say to anything that would distract us from being the best in this space. That includes:
  * Saying no to working with anyone outside the home services or construction space.
  * Saying no to clients who treat marketing like a one-way street.
  * Saying yes to long-term partnerships with growth-minded contractors who are ready to become the top dog in their market.


Today’s buyers Google everything. 75% never scroll past page one. If your website doesn’t show up there, you’re leaving cash on the table every single day.
Our SEO isn’t about chasing vanity metrics. It’s about ranking you for the keywords that matter, showing up in your city and service areas when it counts, and building a brand reputation that makes homeowners trust you before they even talk to you.
Whether you’re a solo operator looking to level up or a seasoned pro ready to dominate your local market—we’re here to help you own your corner of Google.

When challenges come up, we not only maintain a positive attitude, but have fun and use it as an opportunity to improve.

## What is Home Services SEO? (And How Do You Actually Do It?)
Home Services SEO is the process of getting your business ranked higher on Google so more homeowners find and contact you—whether you’re in HVAC, plumbing, electrical, pest control, or another home trade.
  * – Service pages, blog posts, and FAQs that answer the exact questions homeowners are typing into Google.
  * – Fine-tuning titles, headers, descriptions, and on-page keywords to rank higher and get more clicks.
  * – Making your site lightning fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to crawl so both users Google love it.
  * – Earning links from trusted industry sites to help Google see you as the go-to expert in your service area.


You can try doing it yourself—or you can hire a team that lives and breathes home services marketing. Either way, with the right approach, you’ll show up when it matters most: when homeowners are ready to buy.
## Home Services SEO: DIY vs. Hiring an Agency vs. Building In-House
To rank well for competitive local keywords, you need three key ingredients:
– Publishing new content regularly: blog posts, local service area pages, and detailed service breakdowns tailored to homeowner search behavior. – Getting other credible sites to link back to you, which boosts your credibility with Google. – Keeping your site fast, mobile-optimized, and updated to meet Google’s latest standards.
We’ve helped HVAC companies triple their lead volume, plumbing businesses dominate their local maps rankings, and home service pros go from obscure to “everywhere” in their city.
We stay sharp by working closely with top players in the industry—refining our process constantly based on real feedback and results.
If you’re doing between $100K–$1M in revenue, you probably don’t need a full-blown agency yet—but that doesn’t mean you should ignore SEO. In fact, this is the time to build your foundation the right way. You or someone on your team can handle the basics:
  * Answer common homeowner questions on a blog once a week.
  * Make sure your site loads fast and looks great on mobile.


Avoid cheap SEO mills that promise the moon for $299/month. Most of them deliver nothing but spammy backlinks and generic content. Your time is better spent learning the basics or hiring a freelancer for targeted help. Build momentum now, and when you’re ready to scale, your foundation will be solid.
If you’re doing over $1M in revenue and want to unlock a predictable stream of high-quality leads, hiring an agency is often the fastest route to results. A specialized home services SEO agency ( hey, that’s us) brings battle-tested systems, deep industry knowledge, and the manpower to execute quickly.
  * Technical fixes that help your site fly on mobile and desktop.


This route is ideal if you want a team already in the trenches, constantly adapting to Google’s updates, and obsessed with what’s working right now for HVAC, plumbing, roofing, and more. It’s not the cheapest option—but it saves you time, drives results faster, and keeps you focused on running the business.
Larger businesses often benefit from owning their marketing internally. If you’ve got a marketing department, the key is to ensure your team has the 
  * – Produces blogs, city pages, and updates service content regularly.
  * – Tracks rankings, handles technical issues, and keeps an eye on algorithm updates.
  * – Coordinates strategy, works across departments, and ensures execution stays tight.


You’ll want to invest in tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Surfer SEO, and Screaming Frog. Set clear KPIs: traffic growth, leads from organic, ranking improvements. This route requires training and leadership, but over time it can lead to stronger brand control and cost-efficiency— you’re willing to commit to doing it right.
If you’re small and scrappy—DIY it.If you’re scaling fast—hire specialists.If you’re already a marketing machine—build it in-house.
No gimmicks. No shortcuts. Just proven paths to more leads and better visibility.
Let us know where you’re at—we’ll give you honest guidance, even if it’s not with us.
For home service companies, success isn’t about ranking nationally—it’s about owning your backyard. That’s where the money is. If someone in your city searches for “AC repair near me,” “plumber in [Your City],” or “roof leak emergency,” and you show up—you’re giving that job to a competitor.
Don’t just have one “Services” page—create a unique, keyword-optimized page for every major service every service area. If you serve 10 cities, you should have 10 service area pages, each targeting “[Service] in [City].” These are SEO gold.
Your is your MVP for local search. Add photos regularly. Respond to every review. Keep hours updated. Use all categories that apply. And post updates every week like it’s your Facebook feed.
Get links from local chambers of commerce, sponsorships, news mentions, or community organizations. These signal to Google that you’re local choice.
Add embedded maps, driving directions, and geo-specific content on pages. Even drop local landmarks in your copy (e.g., “Just down the road from [Local Hardware Store]”)—it’s not just good for readers, Google picks it up too.
Social proof isn’t optional. It’s one of the biggest conversion factors and affects rankings. Encourage reviews on Google, Yelp, and niche platforms. Then plaster those 5-stars all over your site.
If you’re not the clear #1 in your local area online, you’re losing leads. Local SEO isn’t just a checklist—it’s a strategic weapon for home service companies who want to win their market.
Want help building a localized SEO battle plan? We’re ready. Let’s go.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.

  * [How to Optimize your Google Business Profile for HVAC Companies](https://hookagency.com/hvac-marketing/seo/optimize-google-business-profile/)


## HVAC SEO that’s 100% focused on increasing your bottom line
You know what unprofitable leads look like – and you’ve likely worked with companies that just focus on glamour metrics like ‘marketing qualified leads’ that end up wasting your time.
That’s why we partner with you to really outline what your best customers look like, what services they buy – and how they found you, and then get completely focus on SEO that drives return-on-investment.
Our HVAC SEO services focus on increasing this group of people, but expanding on what’s working – and pushing out more content intended to woo these folks.
We know how to get your service pages, and location landing pages both ranking AND converting by making tweaks to the design. That’s what makes us different.
We only spend time on the things that are proven to get home services companies more leads. If the best way to do this was to stand on a street corner with a megaphone, we’d do that.
But as it stands, people are looking for HVAC companies ON GOOGLE. We help your HVAC company stand out by optimizing your website so you come up for the terms that people are searching the most – with content marketing, link-building, and on-page and technical SEO.
If you’re serious about getting your company to the next level – set up a call for a free consultation.
## Should you hire in-house or have an agency do SEO for you?
Key reasons we suggest working with an agency if you’re under 50 Million in revenue:
  * If you haven’t hired 20-30+ people over the years in marketing positions, you may have to make some mistakes before cleaning up that process.
  * The ability for our team to learn and share insights in between accounts can jumpstart the speed to results.
  * We put a high emphasis on DOING what we know works, rather than theorizing. You may waste time with a younger marketer internally if (A.) they are trying to do SEO amongst other things, and (B) they have to take years to get good at SEO if they haven’t done much of it before, or at the level you need them to be.


## But what do you REALLY do, when you do SEO?
  * Technical changes on the website for greater visibility and structure


HVAC SEO 2.0 is our way of describing the next level of HVAC SEO that isn’t just SET IT AND FORGET IT.
That old archaic type of SEO strategy is sold by some of the most well-known HVAC marketing companies out there.
When we started to enter the HVAC space, we saw that something massive needed to change.
  * We’re going to need more and better content (not less, and AI content) to rank.
  * We are going to however going to start needing to leverage AI for content idea generation, outlining our content, and other processes internally to move more quickly and get more done. (Title generation with content calendars, topics + keyword research, on-page SEO + shoulder topics etc. for ROI calculations and Google sheets)
  * Placing the emphasis on content and link-building vs. technical SEO. Technical SEO needs to be correct at a baseline – but spending more than 20% for smaller websites is a wild waste of time – or worse, an excuse to do less on content and link-building for agencies that just want to take your money, and don’t care about return on investment.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
## The last word on Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning SEO
Hook Agency is not a ‘copy + paste’ agency. We don’t do ‘set it and forget it’ SEO. We do have a high standard for our employees, and actually for our clients as well. We like to work with clients who are growth-minded, understand their numbers, and are calm not agitated.
If you remember only 3 things about our HVAC SEO services, remember we’re custom, consistent and transparent.


So if you want to know the actual work your marketing company did for SEO each month, work with Hook Agency. We provide a Google drive folder with all of your marketing deliverables every month, and you can look back through the months and see what we did every month of the year.






We have in-house writers, and a team 100% dedicated to contractors. Other HVAC SEO clients we serve appreciate our directness and aggressiveness.
  * We believe in , and drive traffic with link-building as well.
  * We know how to design premium professional , and make design and development changes to your website within our SEO retainer.
  * We go to great lengths to make sure every client is beyond satisfied.
  * We can serve you with at the same time!


We first dig into what makes your company special, and talk through your most lucrative services.
Then – we do our research, finding what key phrases your competitors are ranking for.
We utilize this data, our creativity, and the context from our initial kickoff to formulate a content calendar, all while optimizing your website on the technical side to get higher on Google, and starting the ‘link-building’ process.
Then we establish a monthly rhythm on checking in with you – based on your feedback on the content calendar, we rhythmically push on content, links, and technical changes.
Our content strategy is both article focused, and ‘landing page’ focused – going after money-making keywords first and foremost.
We give you a live marketing dashboard, to track our progress getting you more traffic & leads – and we do a monthly call.
Our clients love our customer service focus, and having a partner they can trust in the corner when it comes to dominating Google.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
## Get an HVAC website design that is conversion-focused and will bring you more leads
Having a website is only the first step in the equation. If you have an that isn’t converting people into leads and is not getting any business from your website, you will have a tough time when your other methods are failing to bring you business.
Have you ever heard of the saying you don’t want all your eggs in one basket? Well if you have a high converting website, this will give you another way to build your business and get the that your company needs.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their HVAC needs. We love helping HVAC companies get more leads with !
We put our clients first, and we take the time to understand their specific business model and the unique needs that they have. That’s why having experience with other HVAC companies is such a benefit because we have already put in the hours to discover opportunities in your industry.
We understand your business, and we know how the industry works.
We also recognize that most HVAC business owners are incredibly busy, spending long days on-site, managing their employees, and often doing manual work themselves. They need a company that can get on with the job and who makes cooperating a breeze, rather than a chore.
The last thing that you want as a client is to have to work with a company that is continually requiring your input and guidance, instead, you want to hire professionals that can take the lead but also work cooperatively with you to produce a fantastic website.
##### Do I Need to Hire a HVAC Niched Website Design Company?
While you could choose to design a website yourself, without any technical expertise, it’s going to be a complicated process and one that will take up to hundreds of hours of your time. On the other hand, we have a team of dedicated professionals who can create a sophisticated website that would be too technical for you to create alone.
The structure of your website is incredibly important. Not only will it help visitors to navigate the site and discover your services, but it also helps you to rank higher in Google. And we know that Google has an overwhelming market share, with the majority of searches happening through their search engine.
If you’re not ranking in Google for your chosen keywords, you’re leaving money on the table. That’s why we design our websites from the ground up with SEO in mind, to ensure that the on-page SEO forms a strong foundation for our future marketing efforts (like .)

You work hard to maintain your business, so you probably want to stretch your advertising dollars as far as possible. That means there’s not much margin for error when it comes to paying for marketing. However, marketing is necessary to and expand your business.
So, how much time can you commit to learning how to market your business effectively? There are a lot of components, including design, copywriting, and . Perhaps you could contract some aspects and do the rest yourself, but that still takes you away from the work that matters.
Whether you’re frustrated with Google ads that don’t quite perform or hoping to branch out to social media platforms, like Facebook, we can help. Don’t guess or take chances with your budget. Let our team of experts craft a custom campaign that actually works, so you can focus on running your business.
This is where Pay-Per-Click, an innovative online advertising model, takes center stage. It’s the fuel that propels HVAC businesses into the digital stratosphere, putting their products and services right in the spotlight. This potent strategy empowers you to strategically place advertisements online, driving customer engagement and escalating business growth like never before. Welcome to the future of HVAC marketing – harness the power of PPC and witness your business take flight.
PPC, in the world of digital advertising, stands for Pay-Per-Click. This advertising model allows businesses, including those in the HVAC industry, to place online ads and pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. It’s a way of buying visits to your site, rather than attempting to earn them organically. This strategy can lead to increased visibility, higher traffic, and potentially more conversions for your HVAC business.
A prime example of PPC (Pay-Per-Click) advertising is Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords. In this system, businesses bid on keywords relevant to their products or services. When users search for those keywords on Google, the business’s ad may appear at the top of the search results page.
Let’s consider an HVAC company, “Cool Breeze Comfort Solutions.” They might bid on keywords like “AC repair,” “heating services,” or “HVAC maintenance.” When a user types these keywords into Google, an ad for “Cool Breeze Comfort Solutions” could appear above the organic search results. Each time a user clicks on their ad, leading them to the “Cool Breeze Comfort Solutions” website, the company pays a predetermined fee. This is a classic example of how PPC advertising operates.
If you’re reading this, chances are you’re an HVAC company looking to supercharge your marketing efforts. You’re in the right place. Today, we’ll be turning up the heat on HVAC PPC (Pay-Per-Click) strategies, introducing unusual ideas and hot takes that will leave your competition in the cold. Brace yourselves; it’s time to revolutionize the way you think about PPC.
  1. We’re starting with a controversial tip: Bid on your own brand name. It may sound counter-intuitive – why pay for clicks you’re already getting organically? But here’s the twist: if you don’t, your competitors might. They could hijack your brand’s visibility, riding on your reputation to lure away potential customers. So, challenge the status quo and protect your brand!
  2. Negative keywords are your secret weapon. They prevent your ads from appearing in irrelevant searches, saving you precious ad spend. In the HVAC industry, this can be crucial. Ensure you’re not wasting money on searches for “HVAC jobs” or “DIY HVAC repair.” This might be a bold move, but it’s one that will pay off.
  3. HVAC services are highly seasonal, and your PPC campaigns should reflect that. When summer’s scorching heat or winter’s freezing cold hits, people are looking for HVAC solutions. Capitalize on these hot and cold periods to maximize your ROI.
  4. Let’s be radical here: Broad, sweeping campaigns might sound appealing, but they can end up being a drain on resources. Instead, focus on hyperlocal targeting. Your next customer might be just around the corner, and with hyperlocal PPC, you can make sure your ad is the first they see.
  5. In this age, not having a mobile-optimized PPC campaign is akin to leaving money on the table. More than half of all web traffic now comes from mobile devices. If your PPC campaign isn’t optimized for mobile, you’re missing out on a huge chunk of potential customers. So go ahead, defy convention and optimize your campaign for mobile-first.
  6. Let’s challenge the notion that PPC is all about the ad itself. A great ad can attract clicks, but it’s the landing page experience that converts those clicks into customers. Make sure your landing page aligns with your ad, answers potential questions, and has a clear call to action.
  7. Here’s a hot take: PPC is not a “set it and forget it” type of strategy. The most successful campaigns are those that undergo continuous testing and tweaking. Always be on the lookout for what works, what doesn’t, and how you can improve. This is the path to PPC success.

**, and mention the ‘Free PPC Opportunity Report’**
After we have an initial call – we can take a look at your area, key services you want to target, and how many people are searching in your area – and put together a report similar to this:






We see company’s doing PPC that know how to spend money quick and in-efficiently. We pride our selves on a slower approach, building up what’s working, and trimming negative keywords that don’t make you money. We may not spend 10k the first month, but we also make sure your spending is much more targeted than many who may be more reckless.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
Visual/display ad design is part of the initial fees on your PPC campaign. We have the staff to help you with this and are willing to price them efficiently as part of an initial project or down the road. Be confident knowing that all of our skills are in-house and ready to help at any time. Including coders, designers, writers, and SEO specialists + along with your Roofing PPC / Google ad specialists that will be running your campaigns.
We start at $2k for any spend under $5k in budget, and it scales up slowly from there for higher spends. We try to be extremely reasonable in our pricing, and it includes setup and monthly reporting. We are open to reporting more often at the beginning of our services, but in general after the first few months – we find it makes sense to share key findings and changes in a monthly call.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.






We are marketing pros and are multi-talented in the world of digital marketing. What do we mean by this? Well, we are able to build websites that look aesthetically pleasing to the eye but also understand what it takes to bring people onto those websites which are designed in a conversion-focused way and will bring you more leads.
  * We believe it is important for you to be able to handle your marketing and understand what is going on
  * We don’t believe in long term contracts and keeping you “trapped”
  * You will get a live marketing dashboard along with monthly reporting
  * We love working with contractors and know what strategies give them the best results


Our timeline on websites is right around 100 days where we do a fully custom design and development of the site so that it is made specifically for your company. There are several companies that are out there using a different approach with their business by using WordPress themes or just by taking the easy road and not doing necessary steps to make the process move faster. When you work with these types of companies, they may be cheaper, but that’s because there is less effort going into it and you’ll probably end up coming to us again later to get things right.
##### How long does it take for SEO to get results?
SEO is not something that takes off overnight – it is actually a process that takes around 3 to 6 months to see clear results so you see that things are working well. There will be another stage at the 6 to 9-month mark where you will see your ROI to be seen and will also have a pretty sizable increase in the number of leads you have.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
When you have a website that nobody ever sees or comes across, it isn’t doing any good for anybody, not even you.
This is why it is important to have SEO. SEO helps your business’ website to be seen by more of your ideal customers and brings you more of those ideal customers you are searching for.






works by modifying elements on a website like the meta title and meta description of a page to ‘optimize’ it to get the most possible traffic. ‘Keyword targeting’ can determine which words you should be aiming for, and getting links from other high authority sites and creating relevant content on your web page and via articles on your site can shift your website up in search rankings over time.
This is different from PPC / as they are usually above the organic listing, and have a little ad identifier next to them (where 80% of people skip them, they still can drive powerful revenue.)
Any way of getting more customers to be aware of your company is important – particularly when they are looking for a product or service like yours. That is why search engine traffic is ideal. You can pay for ads at the top of search engine results and in various places on the web, but only 18% of clicks in search engines go to these ads because many customers are savvy enough to skip them.
They trust in the algorithm of Google to serve the best results towards the top of the ‘organic’ results, or the other results besides the ads – your job (or a professional experts’ job) is to make sure your website is seen as the best result. The top 3 results for any one term get the lion’s share of the clicks, and the first page is generally the cutoff point for any meaningful traffic for most terms besides high volume ones.
Try and become a trusted authority in your field. This will naturally bring you things like links back to your website, more traffic, and greater authority on search engines.

Creating your dream website is our goal. That’s why we make it a priority to talk to you and your staff throughout the process to ensure that we are heading in the right direction and end up with an entirely crafted final product.
Most of the websites that we create for our clients use the WordPress content management system. WordPress is an incredibly intuitive yet robust system that is simple to edit and has extensive functionality. By using a system like WordPress, you as a client can easily modify parts of the website in the future and upload fresh content to your site.
is relatively sophisticated, but we want to ensure that once the website is complete, you are capable of managing and operating that site. We’re not here to handcuff you and charge you update fees; we want to create a quality product for you and give you the ability to operate it.
Your website is the face of your brand. When people search in Google and other search engines for your business, it will appear and give them more information about the services that you offer. This can encourage them to hire you, bringing in more revenue for your business.
Not only that but with the correct SEO, you can also rank for queries like “best landscape designer” and “landscaper near me,” which will bring in more visitors. Ranking for these queries can be exceptionally valuable because these searchers are ready to hire someone ASAP.
Studies have shown that SEO is extremely cost effective when compared to traditional advertising methods. The return-on-investment is better, and the upfront cost is often much lower.
While TV advertising is a pay and pray strategy, SEO can be much more targeted, and if you choose the right keywords, it can bring in thousands of potential customers each month.
To rank for these keywords, we will use both on-page and off-page tactics to optimize your website for the keywords that you want to try and rank for.
On-page SEO is characterized by the content of your web pages and the overall structure of the website. Both of these factors will impact how Google crawls your site and what keywords it thinks that you should rank for.
Our goal with on-page SEO is first and foremost to create quality content that will solve user’s problems and therefore bring value to the internet. However, we also recognize that the search engines are robots and that means that we need to give them hints to explain the context of the page to them.
To do this, we use keywords, the phrases that you want to rank for, in the content. These keywords are extraordinarily powerful in your title, header tags, and meta information.
The search engines crawler will read that information and understand the content on the page, making it more likely that you will rank for those keywords. As well as improving the content on your pages we also work on the overall structure of your website.
The base structure of a website is critical for SEO, and that’s why it’s a great idea to hire the same company to design your site as well as to manage your SEO.
Off-page SEO boils down to getting more links from quality websites pointing back to the pages that you want to rank. To acquire these links, we will perform legitimate digital marketing techniques to give your site publicity.
By ranking higher in the search engine results pages, you should be able to bring in more significant quantities of traffic and a higher quality of traffic that is more likely to convert.
Overall, digital marketing means more people on your website and therefore more opportunities for you to sell to that traffic and to convert them into paying customers. At the very least you would hope to encourage them to sign up to your email list, where you can market to them again.

We love getting results for our clients with Landscaping PPC and know that we are able to help you and your business get more leads. When you pay for PPC, you get put on the top of search results for certain keywords making you more visible than the competition.
Having this is great for when you are not established in your area so you are able to be seen. It is also great even if you are experienced and have been around for a while so that people will know that you’re still relevant and at the top of your game.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








While it is a tempting thought that throwing in lots of money really fast will get you really fast results, it is not always true. We like to take a slower approach to make sure you are getting in front of the right audience and get results.
We then trim off the parts that are not performing and expanding the areas that are performing well for your business. This gives you a truly customized campaign that benefits your company. This way, you are able to get the best results.
SEO and PPC are both great marketing strategies that are able to benefit your business. However, there are a few differences between them.
With , it is a longer approach. Similar to an investment, it will accumulate growth as time goes on and build further and further traction.
With PPC, it is like you get the wealth instantly, but the second you stop spending, the wealth is all gone and won’t come back until you start paying again.
Pricing starts at $2k for budgets under $5000 and scales up from there.
With our PPC services, you will get a monthly reporting call that will give you updates on everything that is going on so you can get a better understanding of what is happening. You are able to get more reporting calls, but it is recommended that you just stick with the one per month, as more are usually not necessary.

And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
##### How are we different from the other painting marketing companies out there?
Here at Hook, we take the time to get to know our clients and the people their business serves so we can get the best understanding of who their target audience is and how to reach them. Once we have this information, it allows us to use the tools that we have to do keyword research on what people are looking for as well as performing a competitive analysis on your competition to see what keywords they are ranking for so we can go in and steal that top spot from them.
Our website process is usually around a 100-day timeline that starts with a kickoff meeting that lets us get an understanding of your company and who your audience is. During this meeting, we ask the important questions that give us a better understanding so we can get you the most effective design possible. After that we move into the design process and where we design the site, go over the internal review, and then do our design presentation. When we get sign-off on the design, we move into the development of the website where we make it come to life. After this, we do the content entry and QA phases of the project before it is ready to launch.
##### How long does it take for you to get more leads?
When you start SEO, it is going to take a little bit of time for results to come, think around three to six months for you to start seeing your traffic number shoot up. Once you get to the six to nine-month mark you will see significant growth in traffic and leads that help to build your business.
PPC on the other hand will get you visibility right away, however, once you decide not to use these services, the results will no longer be there like they would with SEO.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.

"Hook Agency has been a pleasure to work with. Everyone that we work with is smart, focused and serious about their work. Hiring Hook has given me peace around our lead generation.

Thank you Vinny and thank you Hook Agency!"
Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








##### How are we different from the other painting marketing companies out there?
Here at Hook, we take the time to get to know our clients and the people their business serves so we can get the best understanding of who their target audience is and how to reach them. Once we have this information, it allows us to use the tools that we have to do keyword research on what people are looking for as well as performing a competitive analysis on your competition to see what keywords they are ranking for so we can go in and steal that top spot from them.
##### How long does it take for Painting SEO to work?
With SEO, it takes time and isn’t going to be an overnight success story. If you’re looking for that, PPC may be a better option for you but those results stop the minute you stop paying for them, so if you’re going to invest in something, why not make it last?
With SEO, it will usually take around 3-6 months before you start to see results, and after the 9-12 month mark is where you will start to notice a larger increase of leads.
We have a reporting meeting each month, so you know where things are at and always know what we’re working on.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

Show that you’re the best option around by getting a website that reflects the quality of work that your business does for your customers.
  * Our sites are specifically designed to rank highly in Google 
  * Your new site will help drive quality leads and conversions 


We have monitored the analytics on 100’s of contractors websites and know what drives people to take action. We build in trust factors, and persuasive images and headlines to drive leads.
Where website design + combine to bring in the right people right when they’re searching. That’s our speciality – we build the site with SEO in mind from the beginning.
We know some people don’t read. We skip to the point right when they land on the website to give them a reason to contact you right away, or at least let them know the point of the website from the outset.
### You know how to paint, we know how to build websites
Do you really want to leave your website’s design in your own hands? If potential customers can’t find you on the internet or they are turned off by your website, you’re throwing away thousands of dollars in possible leads each month. Unfortunately, web design isn’t simple, and it can be near impossible for the average person to make a website.
  * We find a lot of meaning in our work – designing high-end websites that create conversions for small businesses like yourself.
  * We know how to help people trust you on your website, and we’d love to share with you our strategies.


Having a website is only the first step in the equation. If you have a website that isn’t converting people into leads, and you are not getting any business from your website, you will have a tough time when your other methods are failing to bring you business.
If you have a high converting website, this will give you another way to build your business and get the leads that your painting company needs.
  * Getting more website traffic is the first step to getting more leads with conversion potential, and we’ll help you do just that.
  * With qualified designers and developers, we’ll take all the website work off of your plate so that you can focus on running your business.

These days, many of the searches that are being done are coming from things such as mobile devices and tablets. Right around 50 percent to be precise.
This means that if you don’t have a mobile-friendly device, you could be missing out on 50 percent of the potential customers that are out there because they aren’t able to navigate your site.
Our website design always makes this a priority because we know how important it is.
##### Do you only create websites that are backed by WordPress?
Our team wants to deliver a quality, SEO-friendly website to you and your business. To keep our process simple and effective, we lean on the WordPress platform because of its many benefits.
First, WordPress sites are the most mobile-friendly. When your website is optimized better for mobile, you will rank higher in the search results and gain more qualified leads. WordPress provides a variety of beautiful mobile-friendly web design templates that communicate your brand effectively.
WordPress also has systems in place to protect against the pains of hacking and cyber theft. Because of its useful plugins and cloud storage, you can back up your website content in a secure location.
When it comes to the various media types, WordPress websites can accommodate all. You can make your website as entertaining as possible. There are easy ways to embed Instagram photos, YouTube videos, Tweets, and Soundcloud audio clips by placing a URL in the editor fields.

As a digital marketing agency, we are multi-talented with the work we do unlike some of the other agencies that specialize in one or the other. Our websites look great and convert visitors into leads and our SEO drives traffic onto your site so you can get more leads.
  * We want to help you get to understand your marketing and handle it
  * We have the strategies that work for your paving company to get more results


Our timeline on websites is right around 100 days where we do a fully custom design and development of the site so that it is made specifically for your company. There are several companies that are out there using a different approach with their business by using WordPress themes or just by taking the easy road and not doing necessary steps to make the process move faster. When you work with these types of companies, they may be cheaper, but that’s because there is less effort going into it and you’ll probably end up coming to us again later to get things right.
##### How long does it take for Paving SEO to get results?
We know how to do some great SEO, but unfortunately, those results don’t happen overnight and take around 3 months for you to see results. It will also be around 6 months before you will start to see a return on investment. SEO is a great strategy but it is important to remember that these results take a little bit to get to but are well worth the wait!

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
As a company that prides itself on quality work, you need a website that will ack you up and show those potential customers that you are the real deal and here’s why they should come to you for your services.
When you have a website that is high quality and doesn’t give people a reason to not trust it, you will see a major uptick in the amount of leads that you are getting for your business that are brought in from your website.
If you are serious about getting more leads and bringing your business more opportunities, then give us a shoutout and see if we’re the right fit for each other.
##### Do I Need to Hire a Paving Niched Website Design Company?
While you could choose to design a website yourself, without any technical expertise, it’s going to be a complicated process and one that will take up to hundreds of hours of your time. On the other hand, we have a team of dedicated professionals who can create a sophisticated website that would be too technical for you to create alone.
The structure of your website is incredibly important. Not only will it help visitors to navigate the site and discover your services, but it also helps you to rank higher in Google. And we know that Google has an overwhelming market share, with the majority of searches happening through their search engine.
If you’re not ranking in Google for your chosen keywords, you’re leaving money on the table. That’s why we design our websites from the ground up with SEO in mind, to ensure that the on-page SEO forms a strong foundation for our future marketing efforts.
We put our clients first, and we take the time to understand their specific business model and the unique needs that they have. That’s why having experience with other Paving and construction companies is such a benefit because we have already put in the hours to discover opportunities in your industry.
Another paving web design company might primarily have experience designing and marketing websites in the medical fields, and how related is that to paving?
We understand your business, and we know how the industry works.
We also recognize that most roofers are incredibly busy, spending long days on-site, managing their employees and often doing manual work themselves. They need a company that can get on with the job and who makes cooperating a breeze, rather than a chore.
The last thing that you want as a client is to have to work with a company that is continually requiring your input and guidance, instead, you want to hire professionals that can take the lead but also work cooperatively with you to produce a fantastic website.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their paving needs.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
PPC is a marketing strategy that can bring effective and attract new business for your company if you are doing them the right way.
With our PPC strategy, we are able to get your business the results you are looking for. With our highly skilled and hard working team, we get our clients the best results possible without you breaking the bank and wasting your hard earned dollars on marketing that doesn’t work.
You know your business, and we know marketing. Together we can come up with a plan that works and delivers results and helps your business grow.






Paving PPC is something that, if you know what you’re doing, you can do on your own, but if you don’t have the time to learn and master that, you are just throwing away your marketing dollars.
We take the time to be sure that you are getting results that benefit your company and are always changing and tweaking things so that you aren’t paying for certain keywords that don’t work.
PPC and SEO are both focused on getting in front of people on search engines. PPC means you pay Google (or Bing) to be shown towards the top – and SEO means you try to make tweaks to your site and content to get shown higher in the unpaid results.
We strongly suggest a campaign that includes both elements, as our absolute ideal is to be shown 4 times on the first page for a company’s top money-making keywords. (Once in the top ads, the top map ad, in the organic map results, and ideally #1 in the organic results as well.)
Because many people skip the ads – we believe if you have to choose only one strategy, you should spend money on Search Engine Optimization first, but it does depend on your unique situation and needs.
Nobody reads ads that aren’t visually appealing. Since visual elements are key aspects of advertising, especially PPC campaigns, we don’t upcharge for the ad designs. Instead, we include ad design in your initial fee package.
If you also desire landing pages, you have the option to add them separately at any stage of the process. Our team can design custom landing pages that fit with your campaign.
##### How long does my PPC advertisements last after I stop paying?
Well, the answer to this one is pretty simple. They don’t last. When you stop paying for PPC, you will not see any further results when you stop feeding it money. This is why we recommend SEO because even when you decide to stop paying for the services, your results will still be there and last longer.

## GET AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION AND WORK WITH PAVING SEO TO GET MORE TRAFFIC
When you have a website, it doesn’t matter how pretty or shiny it is, it just matter how effective that it is and if it is able to bring your conversions and leads. When you have a website that doesn’t do any of this, it is going to be tough for you to get the results you need in order for your business to succeed.
When you partner with a company like us, we help get people onto your site so that you have more traffic and opportunities to convert them into leads. Our approach has been proven and we know what it takes to get people onto your site and turn them into leads.






And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
##### Why should I trust your process – do you have SEO reviews?
We have tons of reviews from clients that we have worked with so you can trust our word that we’re going to work our tails off to get you the best results possible.
We found a strategy that works for getting more leads and will use it to the fullest to bring you the leads that you are looking for.
Send us a message now, so we can make you the perfect example of what it looks like to ‘dominate Google.’
##### How long does it take for Paving SEO to work?
With SEO, it takes time and isn’t going to be an overnight success story. If you’re looking for that, PPC may be a better option for you but those results stop the minute you stop paying for them, so if you’re going to invest in something, why not make it last?
With SEO, it will usually take around 3 months before you start to see results, and after the 6-month mark is where you will start to notice a larger increase of leads.

##### How do you differ from other pool installer marketing companies?
We take the time to really get to know your company and who your target audience is so we can be sure to target them and bring them onto your site. We find the keywords that they are searching for and the ones that your competition is ranking for then go in and take those keywords so you can rank higher on Google so you can get more of the leads that you’re looking for.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
##### Do you help with making sure the website ‘converts’ traffic too?
We use a custom dashboard for your business to monitor our success, and the dashboard focuses on our next steps, and **the actual amount of contact form submissions, phone calls or e-commerce sales** that a client receives for the month.
We love helping clients determine what a lead from their website is worth so there is accountability, transparency, and understanding of the R.O.I. that comes from our services. We insist on this and we thrive off of it. It’s not uncommon for companies to come away from the first couple months working with us with a much deeper understanding of how their website converts visitors into leads and what that means for their bottom line. We love this – and learn a ton from each of our clients as well.
We love working with smart entrepreneurs, small business owners, and marketing directors – and would love an opportunity to chat with you about your business and what could do for you. Contact us now.

## Plumbing Search Engine Optimization that’s an Investment in your Website’s Future
The best part about Search Engine Optimization is that you’re not just paying for ads that go away once you stop paying.
Check out this – about why SEO is smart for plumbers.
Search Engine Optimization is an investment in the long-term future of your website’s traffic and leads.
Plumbing companies have a big opportunity to increase their online presence. The key is – not choosing a low-quality provider who can put your website at risk, but rather choosing someone who has in-house writers, and long-term minded tactics and monthly reporting.
Always have a dashboard at your fingertips that gives key metrics, and what your SEO team is up to, get a plumbing SEO free consultation now.
Because we believe in the people behind the plumbing trucks. The ones who show up rain or shine, solve messy problems without complaint, and keep their communities running. That kind of grit deserves great marketing—and we’ve built our agency around delivering just that.
We’ve developed clear, repeatable systems tailored specifically to home services companies, and we know how to set honest, realistic expectations—for both your team and ours. No fluff. Just results.
Our sales process is built to be respectful of your time. We don’t send over a quote unless we’ve had a real conversation, built some trust, and truly believe our Plumbing SEO and local search strategies can help you earn way more than you’re spending.
If you’re curious about what’s possible, we’d love to show you. Book , and we’ll walk you through how we could grow your visibility—and fill up your calendar.
Plumbing SEO is the strategy of getting your website to rank higher on Google so more homeowners find you when they need help fast. Here’s how we make it happen:
  * – Service pages, blogs, and FAQs that answer common plumbing questions and pull in local traffic.
  * – Sharpening your meta titles, descriptions, and on-page keywords so you rank better and get more clicks.
  * – Speeding up your site, making it mobile-friendly, and structuring it for both Google and your customers.
  * – Building links from high-authority sites that tell Google, “This is the plumber to trust.”


You can try to DIY it—or work with a team that’s obsessed with getting plumbing companies like yours to the top of local search. Either way, the right SEO strategy brings in more calls from homeowners who are ready to book now.
**But here’s what you need to look for (or do) if you’re looking for the best SEO for plumbers:**
  * Heavy duty content systems like location landing pages, blog posts, and ways to ever-increase the width of the sales funnel, by increasing the possible entry points to the website.
  * Heavy duty linking systems like , Help a Reporter Out, , and creative blogging to go after things writers want to link to (Statistics and graphs are one example.)
  * Technical SEO like using Rankmath WordPress plugin to de-index thin and duplicate content, cleaning up site speed with caching, and regularly updating content with H2’s, bolding sentences with keywords, adding alt text to images, and increasing the ease of navigating around the site and the URL structure to increase interlinking and relationship keys from different pages with that and internal linking.


But that’s why we’re here to do everything for you on a regular basis.
### Resources to learn more about Plumber SEO if you want to dive in yourself
There’s a wide, beautiful world out there that is available to those who want to dive and and get really heavy-duty on SEO, even by themselves.
I’ve curated some of the top resources for learning SEO – even if you don’t hire Hook Agency, or another highly-rated with .
  * [SEO Basics: 3 Things I Would Do If Nothing Else](https://hookagency.com/blog/seo-basics/)
  * – high-level – you need to identify plumbing keywords people are searching, then create in-depth pages to help those people with their searches, and actually ‘fulfill the intent of the search,’ by making a better page or post than the other top 3 posts on that topic.


### As of writing this we have several companies we’re doing plumbing SEO for and that number is growing
For one – there’s not as many plumbing SEO companies out there, as some niches.
We’ve been helping home service businesses win online for 8+ years, but niched into home services only in mid 2021. This allows us to get hyper focused on what works on / + what actually produces leads for our clients.
  * We not only track your leads, but we also check each one to make sure they are legit.
  * We not only do keyword research for you, but we write 3,000 words a month to take the needed steps to actually rank on Google.
  * We not only make suggestions on the design and development of the website for SEO, we will make them.


### Most Plumbing SEO Companies Phone It In—and Hope You Don’t Notice
They claim they’re doing SEO, but behind the scenes, it’s just the bare minimum—propped up by your paid ad budget.
When a company’s spending $10K–$20K a month, it’s easy for an extra $2K “for SEO” to fly under the radar. But we started with lean, hungry plumbing businesses—where every dollar is tracked, and results matter. That shaped our approach: if you’re investing $1K–$2K a month, you need ROI, not smoke and mirrors.
– SEO legitimately takes time. It’s a long game, and anyone promising overnight success is full of it. – That’s not an excuse to stay vague or keep you in the dark. You deserve to see exactly what’s being done each month—and track the progress every step of the way.
That’s how we roll: clear work, visible wins, and accountability baked in.
### To combat this problem – we’ve made the following improvements
  * Live dashboard with all of your stats year over year
  * A Google drive folder with deliverables from every month of work.
  * Writing the content, earning the links, and actually doing the design and development.


**Don’t get caught up with a fake SEO agency – work with a company that’s as transparent as you are about what you got done.**

Plumbing SEO is the process of optimizing plumbing websites for search engine algorithms to increase their visibility and generate more leads. With the growing competition in the plumbing industry, it has become vital for businesses to invest in SEO to stay ahead of competitors and reach more customers. A plumbing SEO company can provide services such as keyword research, website optimization, and content creation to help you achieve higher rankings in search engine results.
It’s essential to understand that website quality plays a critical role in plumbing SEO. A well-optimized website for search engine algorithms is more likely to achieve higher rankings in search engine results, ensuring a strong online presence in both the plumbing and HVAC industries. Implementing effective HVAC SEO strategies can further enhance your online visibility.
Plumbing SEO is a specialized search engine optimization approach designed specifically for plumbing companies. By incorporating relevant plumbing keywords into your Google Business Profile, website, and plumbing blogs, you can improve your web pages’ search engine ranking, making it easier for customers to discover your plumbing company. With the help of plumber SEO services, you can effectively optimize your online presence and attract more clients.
Long-form content plays a vital role in enhancing the duration of time a user spends on the page, leading to better search engine rankings and increased visibility.
In an industry as competitive as plumbing, SEO is essential for raising your online presence and drawing in more clients. To identify your competitors in plumbing SEO, investigate the top listings when searching for relevant keywords such as “plumber in [my city]” and “local plumber near me.” Additionally, researching individual plumbing companies to determine directories they are listed on, social media platforms they utilize, and content they share with their audience can be beneficial.
Investing in plumbing SEO can bring several advantages, such as:
  * Submitting website URL and other pertinent information to be featured in specific categories online


However, without investing in plumbing SEO, the likelihood of obtaining a top ranking in search results is minimal. In other words, SEO is the lifeline that keeps your plumbing business afloat in the digital ocean of competition.
Content is a key factor in determining the ranking of a plumbing website in search results. By developing a multi-step digital marketing process specifically designed to assist businesses in improving their position in Google’s search ranking, you can ensure your plumbing business stays ahead of the competition.
Off-page SEO pertains to all SEO activities headed outside of your web page. These efforts help determine the website’s ranking, credibility and trustworthiness on search engines. To achieve the best results, it’s crucial to combine all these elements into a cohesive SEO strategy tailored to your plumbing business’s unique needs and goals.
On-page SEO for plumbers involves optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, and incorporating relevant keywords into plumbing websites. By constructing service pages for each of the services provided, like drain cleaning, and optimizing them with title tags, meta descriptions, and pertinent keywords, you can enhance your plumbing business’s online visibility and attract potential customers.
On-page SEO can help a plumbing business achieve higher rankings in organic search results. By focusing on creating high-quality, informative, and engaging content that caters to the needs of your target audience, you can ensure your plumbing website stands out in the crowded digital landscape and attracts the right kind of traffic.
Off-page SEO for plumbing companies involves link building, guest blogging, and social media marketing to enhance a plumbing business’s online reputation and authority. High-quality backlinks, originating from websites with prominent authority, can have a beneficial effect on your online visibility and search engine rankings. The increasing competition in the plumbing industry has led to a heightened competition for organic rankings in plumbing SEO, making a strong backlink strategy crucial for staying competitive.
Creating relevant content that others may want to link to is one effective link building strategy. Furthermore, guest blogging on reputable sites or running social media ads can also help build the necessary links. By focusing on building a robust off-page SEO strategy, you can enable your plumbing business to achieve higher rankings on search engine results pages, leading to increased website traffic and potential customers.
Technical SEO for plumbing websites entails factors such as site speed, mobile-friendliness, and website architecture, which are essential for providing an optimal user experience and achieving higher search engine rankings. The optimal website loading time for plumbing SEO is less than three seconds. If your plumbing business’s website load time is longer than five seconds, you should consult an SEO expert or web developer to address the technical issues that may be causing the slow loading time of your site.
Site speed is critical for plumbing SEO as it guarantees that the website loads promptly for users, thus reducing the bounce rate. By addressing technical SEO factors, you can ensure your plumbing website provides a seamless experience for users and ranks higher in search engine results.
Local SEO for plumbers involves optimizing a plumbing business’s online presence for local searches to attract local customers. Local optimization is essential for plumbers, as local businesses gain revenue from consumers within their service area, and local leads hold great value. Joining local business directories such as the local Chamber of Commerce, creating local citations, and utilizing On the Map Marketing can increase visibility for potential customers searching for local businesses.
NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency is a significant ranking factor for local SEO, as it demonstrates to search engines like Google that the information regarding your plumbing business is reliable and authentic. By optimizing your plumbing business for local SEO, you can tap into a valuable source of potential customers right in your service area.
Content marketing plays a crucial role in plumbing SEO, providing a platform to generate engaging, informative, and optimized content to increase search engine rankings.
  * Provide users with information based on their Google keyword searches


Consistency is key when it comes to publishing content for plumbing SEO. By regularly creating high-quality, intent-based content that fulfills the needs of both users and search engines, you can position your plumbing business as a trustworthy industry expert and boost your search rankings.
Maintaining a plumbing blog is beneficial as it increases search engine visibility, demonstrates proficiency, and offers informative content to potential clients. Enter target keywords into Google to find topic ideas for your plumbing blog. Utilize Google autocomplete to identify what users are searching for. The frequency of blog post publishing should be dictated by your goals, whether it’s organic traffic or brand awareness.
  * Effectively position your plumbing business as a go-to resource in the industry


By creating valuable and engaging content that resonates with your target audience, you can achieve these benefits.
Generating service-specific web pages assists plumbing businesses to appear in search results when customers search for a particular service. Each service page should include a description of the service, relevant keywords, and other on-page SEO elements to ensure optimal visibility. For content ideas, we recommend researching the top plumbing blogs on the web.
Optimizing service pages for plumbing SEO can be achieved by:
  * Constructing service-specific web pages with comprehensive descriptions and pertinent keywords to boost search visibility
  * Making it easier for potential customers to find and choose your business


## Leveraging Google Business Profile and Google Maps for Plumbing SEO
Google Business Profile and Google Maps are highly effective tools in plumbing SEO that enhance a plumber’s online presence and facilitate potential customers in locating their services. Including the service area, address, and list of products and services are essential elements to include in a Google Business Profile for plumbing businesses. Google Maps extracts data from a plumbing business’s Google Business Profile to assess if and how the business may appear in local results.
Google Maps can provide plumbing businesses with increased visibility by displaying their location, opening hours, and reviews, thereby allowing potential customers to make informed decisions about their services. By leveraging the power of Google Business Profile and Google Maps, you can effectively boost your plumbing business’s online presence and attract more local customers.
Managing plumbing SEO internally can be cost-effective, but it also comes with its own set of challenges and risks. On the other hand, hiring a professional agency can provide industry expertise, proficiency, and access to cutting-edge tools and methods, ensuring a more successful SEO strategy.
It’s essential to weigh the potential risks and rewards before deciding whether to undertake plumbing SEO independently or engage a professional agency. Factors like time commitment, expertise, and budget should be considered to make the best decision for your plumbing business.
DIY Plumbing SEO has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, it can be a cost-effective option and offer an opportunity to gain knowledge about SEO. Conversely, it can be hazardous and less effective if one lacks plumbing expertise or capabilities.
The advantages of engaging in DIY Plumbing SEO include cost savings and gaining knowledge of SEO. The potential risks associated with DIY Plumbing SEO include the possibility of making errors and the substantial amount of time required to gain an understanding of SEO.
It is essential to evaluate the potential risks and rewards before determining whether to undertake it independently or engage a professional.
Collaborating with a plumber SEO agency can offer advantages such as industry expertise, proficiency, and access to sophisticated tools and techniques. Having industry knowledge, experience, and access to advanced tools and techniques can enable a plumbing SEO agency to gain a better understanding of the plumbing industry and devise more effective SEO strategies.
Increased visibility, higher rankings on Google, improved online presence, and more qualified leads can provide a plumbing business with the opportunity to reach a wider customer base, enhance brand recognition, and create more leads. By partnering with a specialized plumbing SEO agency, you can ensure your plumbing business’s online presence is optimized for success.
Monitoring plumbing SEO initiatives provides the opportunity to assess performance and modify strategies as required. Google Search Console and Google Analytics are two of the most widely used tools for tracking plumbing SEO efforts. Establishing business objectives with the SEO firm is the optimal approach to monitor progress. Additionally, monthly reports of the SEO campaign should be monitored.
The importance of transparency in digital marketing is paramount, as consumers desire to be assured that they can trust the organizations they engage with. By tracking your plumbing SEO performance, you can ensure your efforts are yielding the desired results and make adjustments as needed to continually improve your online presence.
Goals refer to the desired outcomes that a business or project seeks to attain, while KPIs are numerical metrics utilized to evaluate progress towards those objectives. Goals and KPIs are essential for strategic and long-term performance measurement, thus guaranteeing that the business is progressing towards its desired outcomes.
To establish clear objectives and KPIs for your plumbing SEO strategy, focus on quantifiable and traceable metrics such as organic search traffic, website conversions, and keyword rankings. By setting specific goals and tracking KPIs over time, you can pinpoint areas of improvement and adjust your strategies accordingly to achieve better results.
Utilizing analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Search Console can be beneficial in monitoring progress towards objectives. These tools can provide data on website traffic, keyword rankings, and other metrics that can be used to measure progress. Improvement areas can be identified by analyzing website performance data, which can assist in recognizing areas where the website is not performing optimally, such as low organic search traffic or inadequate keyword rankings.

##### Do I Need to Hire a Plumbing Website Design Company?
We strongly suggest working with a freelancer or building out a website on your own when you’re just starting out. We know our plumbing web design services aren’t for everyone.
But… if you have a company over 1 million in revenue, and your time is worth more than your money…
If you understand that PROFESSIONALISM is important, and people really do care about the quality of your service…
The only way they can JUDGE the quality of your service, without inspecting every toilet and sink you’ve ever installed, or every leak your company has ever fixed, is by the VISIBLE website that you present to the world.
We know how to help people trust you on your website, and we’d love to share with you our strategies.
Our team has been working with WordPress for years now, and we are incredibly competent are editing and customizing the system to suit our needs. Moreover, WordPress is incredibly intuitive which makes it ideal for our clients in the home construction and remodeling industry.
Unless you have technical expertise, you are unlikely to be able to manage a website that is built purely with HTML and CSS, without any content management system.
The reason why we chose WordPress over other content management systems is that it has the best level of support and the most significant community. This support means that there are thousands of themes, plugins, and websites dedicated to WordPress.
This system gives us and you the most flexibility when it comes to design, functionality, and support. Once the design has been completed and handed over to your team, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to manage the website going forward.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their roofing needs.
We are extremely honest, and practical – we can help direct you to another , that would be better if we aren’t the right fit. 
This can change however depending on several factors such as the size of the site, or the involvement of the party getting the website.
##### What is your pricing and how cost-effective is it compared to other lead generation methods?
At Hook Agency, our pricing is structured to deliver maximum ROI for growth-mode companies. We understand that every dollar counts, especially when you’re scaling from $3M to $15M in revenue.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








##### How do you differ from other pool installer marketing companies?
We take the time to really get to know your company and who your target audience is so we can be sure to target them and bring them onto your site. We find the keywords that they are searching for and the ones that your competition is ranking for then go in and take those keywords so you can rank higher on Google so you can get more of the leads that you’re looking for.
And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.

We understand how hard you work to run your business and keep it running, and that you’re not looking to just throw away money. So start investing in someone that actually gets you the results you’re looking for and doesn’t just say they’re doing something.






SEO is still one of the best investments you can make in growing your business, but the use of PPC in tandem with a strong SEO strategy is almost unbeatable. If you have keywords where you don’t currently rank well organically, or if your category has low-search volume and needs to bring in users searching for adjacent keywords – PPC is an absolute necessity.
Driving users to your site through Google AdWords & Bing Ads creates a similar experience to organic search, users feel no less inclined to turn into customers simply because they clicked through an ad. They have demonstrated an intent to engage with a business like yours, using PPC means you can kickstart that engagement.
AdWords can be an expensive channel, especially in categories like law or construction – so you need a well-constructed approach. There is more than just an average CPC (Cost per click) to consider – you need to identify your website conversion rate, your target CPA (Cost per acquisition) and determine the CPC you can accept to make it all run. This is the simplest way to state it, but to make it work you need:
  * Bid position testing – test the right position to grab clicks and conversions
  * Utilize the search-terms report to identify new long-tail keywords and negative search terms to increase efficiency


Sound easy? It’s a time-consuming process. You can use averages as a starting point to determine the cost of traffic for your industry, but from there it can get complicated quick!
##### What’s the difference between SEM, PPC, Paid Search & SEO?
Depending on who you ask, SEM (Search Engine Marketing) is either a synonym for PPC/Paid Search, or is an over-arching term for any marketing done in search engines – organic or paid. Beyond that, PPC/Paid Search/SEM can all be used interchangeably – they all typically refer to using paid ads in a search engine. SEO is all about generating traffic organically, using a combination of Content & Technical SEO tactics to increase your SERP ranking.
Although they are managed in the same advertising platform, Facebook Ads Manager, they have pretty unique characteristics.
Facebook is considered to have an older audience, which is true, but this is a little bit deceptive. Most people between 18-29 (88%) use Facebook, they just have a tendency to use it less – and they also use Instagram (59%). Whereas 79% and 61% of 30-49 year olds & 50-54 year olds use Facebook – but only 31% & 13% use Instagram. You’re getting good audience penetration using just Facebook, but if you want to capture and hold the attention of a larger audience under 29 you need to be in both platforms.
Facebook allows us to use lead ads and has multiple placements in the news feed and right-column, ads are 1200×628. You can use static or video ads, as well as carousel (series of slides), canvas (expandable mobile experience), or collections (an ad with multiple products showcased below it).
In Instagram we can place ads in feed, static or video, ads are 1080×1080 – and we can use Instagram Stories ads shot 9:16. There are no lead ads, but we can still drive traffic to your site to create leads and sales.
Excellent question! Utilizing both is an ideal scenario, as you are reaching two totally different audiences. Bing searchers typically stick to Bing, as do Googlers – so utilizing both ad channels is the best way to reach your entire audience. The synopsis of both channels is as follows:
Google: Contains the vast majority of search volume, highly competitive (more search volume, but higher CPCs) and highly relevant traffic. Tends to skew younger, more tech-savvy. Has a broader range of tools to provide advertisers.
Bing Ads: Runner-up in the world of search engines, skews slightly older – primarily utilized by Windows users who are comfortable with the default experience or utilize the built in Windows 10 search bar (powered by Bing). Volume is much lower in Bing, but traffic is more cost-effective.
AdWords allows us to serve display, or text, ads on a huge variety of websites – these sites opt-in to the AdSense network and allow us to show ads for prospecting (interest, demographic, topic, affinity audiences, etc) purposes or retargeting (previous visitors to your website). Google has given us a really great tool for creating awareness & although it has a much lower conversion rate than search advertising – it can be an effective tool.
It’s complex, and is something of a black-box in terms of how properties are valued, but the simple answer is that the historical performance of your ads, the relevance of your ad to the keyword being searched, the quality of your landing page, and your bid are matched in an auction against other businesses. If you are winning in the categories outside of bid you are given a significant advantage, and will have what is called a higher Quality Score, this means you will need to bid less to earn the same position. You will pay the lowest possible amount per click to attain the position above the next business in line.
Ex. If all factors are equal, but you bid $1 and a competitor bids $.75, you will pay $.76.

_“Just understand Google is God when it comes to home service.” – Tommy Mello, A1 Garage_






We know web design, and we know SEO and how to get your website more leads, but one of our biggest differentiators is the combination of those two to get you more leads than ones that just focus on one or the other.
  * We want you to be able to handle your “own your marketing”
  * We don’t trap you with long-term contracts – our services speak for themselves
  * You will get a live marketing dashboard + monthly reporting
  * We’re contractor focused and have our systems primed for these industries


Our timeline on websites is right around 100 days where we do a fully custom design and development of the site so that it is made specifically for your company. There are several companies that are out there using a different approach with their business by using WordPress themes or just by taking the easy road and not doing necessary steps to make the process move faster. When you work with these types of companies, they may be cheaper, but that’s because there is less effort going into it and you’ll probably end up coming to us again later to get things right.
##### How long does it take for SEO to get results?
SEO is not something that takes off overnight – it is actually a process that takes around 3 to 6 months to see clear results so you see that things are working well. There will be another stage at the 6 to 9-month mark where you will see your ROI to be seen and will also have a pretty sizable increase in the number of leads you have.

## Your website works for you around the clock, selling in your sleep
Digital marketing is a relatively complicated process and one that most home construction businesses don’t understand particularly well. Fortunately, our team has years of experience marketing local businesses and bringing in more sales.
Your marketing should be designed so that it brings in more traffic directly and so that your rankings increase, bringing in traffic more years to come. To do this, we will market your business on websites that will give you powerful backlinks.
Remodeling web design shouldn’t be about just creating a website for the sake of having a website; it should be a process of moving your business closer to your goals. For most businesses, that goal is more revenue, and that means that your website should be designed to drive sales.
We understand the remodeling and home construction industry, and we know how your potential customers operate. With that unique knowledge, we can create websites for the construction industry that are intuitive to use and lead to sales.
Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
  * 90 Days – Development Review + Final Edits 100 Days- Launch


##### Why is a Website Necessary for a Home Remodeling Business?
A single lead in the home construction business can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the cost of a website is only a fraction of that. Digital marketing is one of the cheapest and most effective methods of advertising, and it’s impossible to conduct without a website.
Having a web presence is a fundamental requirement these days if you want to grow a successful company. When people want to learn more about your business they don’t call straight away or check the Yellow Pages, they Google you and visit your website
Our team has been working with WordPress for years now, and we are incredibly competent are editing and customizing the system to suit our needs. Moreover, WordPress is incredibly intuitive which makes it ideal for our clients in the home construction and remodeling industry.
Unless you have technical expertise, you are unlikely to be able to manage a website that is built purely with HTML and CSS, without any content management system.
The reason why we chose WordPress over other content management systems is that it has the best level of support and the most significant community. This support means that there are thousands of themes, plugins, and websites dedicated to WordPress.
This system gives us and you the most flexibility when it comes to design, functionality, and support. Once the design has been completed and handed over to your team, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to manage the website going forward.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their roofing needs.
We are extremely honest, and practical – we can help direct you to another , that would be better if we aren’t the right fit.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
##### How do you differ from other pool installer marketing companies?
We take the time to really get to know your company and who your target audience is so we can be sure to target them and bring them onto your site. We find the keywords that they are searching for and the ones that your competition is ranking for then go in and take those keywords so you can rank higher on Google so you can get more of the leads that you’re looking for.
Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.
Each ‘Content Management System’ is like a type of car – you wouldn’t try to buy a Toyota from a Porsche dealership. requires some specialization as well – and we’ve worked on for many years now, learning the ins and outs of it while finding ways to be more efficient than my competitors. I’ve seen people sell a client Magento (a content management system) because they knew they could get a better margin on it – **even when the client could’ve had an extremely effective website with WordPress + WooCommerce**. I honestly want you to have a website you can make changes on yourself and get the most effective solution for a reasonable price.

## What’s wrong with so many other Home Remodeler SEO services?
We see FAR TOO MANY set it and forget it companies. What does that mean?
  * They do some content for a little bit and it trickles off to 1 blog post a month.
  * They do some initial linking activities but it boils down to basically just ‘local directories.’
  * They don’t get aggressive about page speed, and technical improvements, and time get’s the better of the site. (The internet, like the universe is constantly experiencing entropy, and sites have to improve to compete.
  * They don’t do diligent, customer-centric reporting on a monthly basis.
  * Some of them have no specialty so they waste a ton of time ‘context switching.’


## We ONLY work with home services companies – and we only work on WordPress
Having a real specialty, and a real core focus – allows us to spend the most time on the activities that really matter to your profitability and lead flow.
  * We build out Remodeling SEO pages, on a regular bases – including landing pages, blog posts, and location pages, so that when people are searching in your area they can find you, and you start to show up higher on Google maps.
  * We push on linking activities, including local directories, guest posting, Help a Reporter Out (PR links), and press releases as well. We don’t skimp on creativity and we are always looking for new ways to get links back to our clients that can have an outsized impact on their ranking. Because we work in a tight niche, we’re able to build relationships with more niche link providers as well.
  * We actually make substantial edits on your website, including designing and coding new pages that will be good for SEO, getting hyper focused on page speed, adding structure and code that can help improve the site, and making ‘on-page SEO’ changes, including updating old content and better formatting content for the site to rank.


Nothing is more expensive than not making giant strides towards your revenue goals.
**Cheap SEO will just slow you down, and potentially make you settle for bad jobs.**
You want to be able to be SELECTIVE, and profitable, by having the most choice possible on which deals you do, and aggressive SEO will allow you to do that.
  * Remodelers who are on WordPress (or who want to be) with a domain over a year old.
  * Remodelers who have room to grow in their business, aren’t just trying to stay small.
  * Remodelers who understand online marketing, and believe it’s a significant way to grow their company.
  * **Remodelers who want a more aggressive partner, who is consistently working monthly, diligently on their behalf for their SEO.**








It is anything that has to do with getting more website traffic from search engines – normally these days that means Google, as Google traffic accounts for 2/3rds of all search engine traffic on the internet.
SEO works through many different factors, but the top thee are:
  * By creating a structure of well organized and planned content, both Users and Google are able to navigate it better.
  * You are able to answer customer’s questions and give them information on subjects you are looking to rank for.
  * By earning more high-quality backlinks with authority that help your website that will get you more authority.


Any way of getting more customers to be aware of your company is important – particularly when they are looking for a product or service like yours. That is why search engine traffic is ideal. You can pay for ads at the top of search engine results and in various places on the web, but only 18% of clicks in search engines go to these ads because many customers are savvy enough to skip them.
They trust in the algorithm of Google to serve the best results towards the top of the ‘organic’ results, or the other results besides the ads – your job (or a professional experts’ job) is to make sure your website is seen as the best result. The top 3 results for any one term get the lion’s share of the clicks, and the first page is generally the cutoff point for any meaningful traffic for most terms besides high volume ones.
helps businesses by allowing them to attract more customers to their website and if it’s done right – attract them in a way that they also become customers. This is why we pair with ‘Conversion Rate Optimization’ so that any site we’re doing on also gets improvements in design and development that are intended to make it easy for people to become customers of your business.
You don’t want to just attract people to your site, you want them to take the next steps towards becoming a customer. Your website needs to be compelling and be set up for maximum conversions so that you can get the most out of our Minneapolis services.
##### What is the difference between SEO and paid Google advertisements?
Google advertisements will bring you fast results, but once you stop spending money, you will stop seeing results.
Sioux Falls SEO is able to get your company to rank higher in the search results even after you stop paying for it. It is a process that will keep your business on top of search engines for a longer period of time.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

## What is Roofing SEO? (What is it, and how do you do it?)
Roofing SEO is the strategy of getting your website to rank higher on Google so more homeowners find and contact you. Here’s how it works:
  * – Blog posts, service pages, and FAQs that answer common roofing questions and attract organic traffic.
  * – Fine-tuning meta titles, descriptions, and on-page keywords to boost rankings and click-through rates.
  * – Improving site speed, mobile-friendliness, and site structure so search engines (and customers) love your website.
  * – Getting links from high-authority sites to build credibility and help Google recognize your website as an industry leader.


You can tackle SEO yourself—or partner with a team that lives and breathes roofing marketing. Either way, the right approach can put your business in front of more high-intent customers.
## Roofing SEO: Do it yourself? vs. Hiring an Agency vs. Hiring Internally
**To rank well on Google—especially for competitive roofing keywords—you need three core things:**
– Regularly publishing blog posts, location pages, and service pages that answer what homeowners are searching for. – Getting high-authority sites to link back to you, signaling to Google that you’re a trusted expert. – Ensuring your website is fast, mobile-friendly, and optimized for Google’s algorithm updates.

### The Roofing SEO Plan: 7 Must-Do Steps for Higher Rankings & More Leads
To dominate Google search results, you need a structured, repeatable SEO strategy that covers:


Here’s exactly what to do, why it matters, and how to do it.
### 1. Get Listed on Local Directories & Rack Up 5-Star Reviews
Local directories are websites that list your business (Google My Business, Yelp, Angi, etc.). To rank well, your Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP) must be identical across every listing.
  1. Use Yext, Moz Local, or Fiverr gigs to submit your business to directories.


Google prioritizes businesses with lots of high-quality reviews in Google Maps rankings.
  1. Ask every happy customer personally within 1-2 weeks of project completion.
  2. Make it part of your sales process—don’t leave it to chance.


### 2. WRITE META-TITLES & DESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL YOUR TOP-MONEY-MAKING SERVICE PAGES.
A “meta-title” is the blue text in Google search results pages. A “meta description” is the text that shows below it. You can change this text by using a tool like Yoast SEO or editing it in your content management system/website backend.
**Why are they so important, and how will this make you money?**
These meta-titles and descriptions are INSANELY important for getting higher on Google. Your money-making keywords should be towards the beginning of these. You should use a blend of different keywords – use a tool like Ahrefs, SEMRush, or Google Keyword Planner to see what terms have the most searches – but even attempting to guess at what people are searching and changing these would be better than not filling them out at all.
First, Install Yoast SEO or RankMath – or make sure your content management system (we use WordPress) can edit meta-titles and descriptions.
### 3. CREATE VIDEOS FOR ALL OF YOUR KEY SERVICE PAGES.
Why does video even matter for getting more Google traffic and acquiring leads?
Video is powerful because it helps people stay on your page longer, tells the story / gives your differentiating features more quickly than any other method. Check out how we integrated the most recent video on First American’s site and other ‘trust factors’ to help people understand why they are the ONLY choice in their area for roofing services.
They can tell when people stay on your website and jump right back to search results after viewing your page.
How long they stay, and it’s one component that determines whether Google will serve you up again and whether you get higher in the results.
When people leave the site quickly – Google counts that against you, and too high of a bounce rate, and boom – you drop rankings.
Flip out that phone or get a decent DSLR video camera.
Are you convinced you need to get videos on your site to help people stay on your site longer? Flip out that iPhone and film yourself talking in front of a good looking backdrop or up on the top of the roof. Take it to the next level with a DSLR camera, and use Premiere Pro or iMovie to mix something magical that will keep them watching for a full minute and a half. Boom! Your dwell time average is headed in the right direction.
### 4. GET 5 GUEST POST LINKS BACK TO YOUR SITE.
We help our clients get more guest post links back to their site – amongst ten other methods for getting links back to the site. The concept is simple: find a site with high ‘domain authority’ (check it out with the tool Mozbar) or ‘domain rating’ (check it out with the tool Ahrefs) and ask them if you can write a blog post for them – then link back to your site.
Once you get someone to let you – pay attention to the text you link back to your site with. It should be a mix of your brand, URL, random text, brand, + your money-making keyword, and for your best links, just the keyword = likely [your city] + [your service].
Doing this vigorously month after month helped our client become
### 5. WRITE 700+ WORDS FOR ALL OF YOUR SERVICE PAGES, USE FAQ’S TO AUGMENT YOUR CONTENT
**Why word count matters = Google needs context to what the page is about**
Google can’t read your mind. You have to write content to explain your service using your keyword in subheads and at the beginning and end of the page. Bold a sentence with the keyword, and talk about sub-topics (synonyms + LSI keywords related words to the main topic.)
Google your main topic and look at the words at the bottom: ‘people also search for’ and ‘people also ask.’ Still, the best way to add content is by thinking about what your ideal customers want to know about and asking your salespeople what people ask the most often during the sales process.
Do it now: Google your primary services and look at the ‘people also ask’ meta boxes. Write answers to this content and add the text to your service pages, alternating images and text so it doesn’t suffer from the dreaded ‘wall of text’ – which might drive actual-ideal customers away once they hit the page.
### 6. GET AT LEAST 3 ‘GIANT GUIDES’ OUT ON THE SITE TO AUGMENT “TIME ON SITE.”
For some reason – Google loves it when you provide comprehensive content, which increases ‘dwell time.’ We’ve also seen a lot of evidence that this topical relevance gets shared with different content, not just the guide.
So if you provided a 3000-word guide for ‘siding materials’ – your ‘siding’ page would get more love in Google. It sounds weird – but I’ve seen it repeatedly, and it’s badass.
**Know your ideal customer – and create extensive guides they’d love – make them super-comprehensive**
Don’t just write content to rank; write stuff that actual customers will love. That’s why starting with questions your ideal customers ask and then using one of the keyword research tools to find what keywords people Google related to is powerful.
take a guess, Google that, and see if you can make something 10X as good as the next thing that exists.
### 7. INSTALL YOAST SEO AND DE-INDEX YOUR THIN & DUPLICATE CONTENT.
Yoast SEO makes de-indexing thin and duplicate content easy – you need to know where to look. This is easily one of the most impactful things you can do for your site in less than 10 minutes.
Many sites create extra random pages that don’t show up on the site in an obvious way. If you’ve never worked with a professional SEO company (and sometimes if you have worked with a low-end provider), your site PROBABLY has this, unfortunately. Low-end web designers who work with themes have horrible problems with this – don’t blame them, they don’t know any better!
**Why thin and duplicate content has to be completely de-indexed**
Thin and duplicate content makes your site look like a watered-down mess, and it’s hard for Google to know what page to serve up. In turn, your site might be getting much lower rankings than it deserves – when low-end providers get served above the best – we find that JUST PLAIN WRONG.
Install Yoast, tap SEO > Search Appearance, and De-index tags, categories, and any testimonials or miscellaneous post types.
Just a reminder on some of the website stuff…. If you haven’t done these things from the persuasive web design lesson.
### BONUS: GET A SOLID ‘ONE-TWO PUNCH’ AROUND THE SITE OF CALL-TO-ACTION + TRUST FACTORS – TO INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION RATE.
Who cares if you get people to your site who don’t convert? Make sure your site looks high-end, and always ask for business with a blend of ‘trust factors’ like badges and testimonials + a contact form.

Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
##### How do your roofing SEO services get me more leads?
These marketing techniques are designed to get your website featured around the internet using articles that will link back to the pages that you want to rank.
These links signal to Google that your page is popular and credible, encouraging them to rank it higher in the results pages. Our services often double our client’s website traffic and leads – we can share with you our exact methods, send us a message now!
When I was a web designer at another marketing agency, a woman worked with me – she referred me to her roofer friend who needed a website.
We launched a pretty cool website, I also happened to get a 20k promotion at the job – but I didn’t love it.
I wanted our clients to respect us, and I want to get more specialized (we did everything for everyone.)
And so… when I went out on my own, I started getting more construction and home services clients, particularly roofers.
Roofers now make up over a third of clients, and our biggest specialty is getting them higher on Google.
So you could say SEO for roofing companies is the top specialty for our 28-person team.
We try to get you significant changes within 6 months of working with you and a clear ROI in 9 months.
If you hear that other places can get you results sooner than that, you may want to think twice about them as it is not realistic. If you want real results, it can take more time and effort.
People who are on WordPress (the most popular website backend system.)
People who have over 500 people on their website monthly already.
People who are willing to scale their staff if business takes off.
People who have 1 hour a month to work collaboratively with their SEO company.
People who believe in digital marketing, and understand that getting higher in Google’s organic search can be a significant revenue driver.
SEO is split into two parts; on-page and off-page. On-page SEO is the technical structure of your web pages, and off-page SEO includes signals like the number of links to a page. We do everything that we can to improve both.
  1. Do local directory listings – and make sure you have a consistent name, address and phone number on every single one.
  2. Write meta-titles and descriptions for all of your top money-making service pages, and for that matter – make sure they each have their own page.
  3. Create videos to explain each of your services, ideally on-location. The ‘time on site’ increase that videos bring, actually helps your site rank higher.
  4. Get links back to your site with methods like “guest posting”, which just means writing for other websites and linking back. (we do this for our Roofing SEO clients.)
  5. Write 700+ words on each of your main service pages.
  6. Get at least 3 giant guides out on the site, and write regularly (we also do this for our clients.)


[Click here for a full explanation of our top SEO Tips for Roofers](https://hookagency.com/blog/seo-tips/)
SEO is just one component of a full-stack roofing marketing plan. I break down marketing well into two key buckets:
  1. – You need to have your trucks wrapped, a big sign on your building, and ideally you should be doing events out in the community, involved in local organizations etc. Spreading not only your logo, but also your key value proposition far and wide – means sharing what you stand for with your community. The obvious ones being quality, reliability, and customer service – but how are you different as well. Ideally, people associate that difference with your brand and your broader reputation.
  2. – Any activity that’s intended to get on a rhythmic, regular basis from Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor, to SEO and Pay-Per-Click advertising on Google or Facebook. Think outside the box – but also after you’ve tested numerous ideas, double down hard on what works. This is how and when so many companies come to us – they say, “I already know being high on Google works – we just need help scaling that against our competition.”


– The best marketing looks a little bit like sales, and the best sales looks a little bit like marketing. Be open to a blended approach to your efforts, and don’t just look at your competition for ideas. Chances are – if they’re already doing it, it may not differentiate you from them at all.

We build high-converting Google Ads campaigns for roofers who want real results. From keyword targeting to call tracking and landing pages that convert, we handle the details so you can focus on closing more jobs.


We write ad copy that speaks directly to homeowners with roofing needs—storm damage, leaks, and replacements. Clear, persuasive, and built to drive clicks.
We organize your ad account by service and location. This keeps things efficient and ensures your budget targets the highest-value leads.
We focus on keywords like “roof repair near me” or “roof estimate [city]” that bring in serious buyers, not just clicks.
You’ve built your business with hard work—now it’s time to let your marketing do some heavy lifting. We help roofing companies turn Google Ads into booked jobs and steady growth.
Our team specializes in roofing PPC, with Google Ads pros, writers, and devs working together to maximize every dollar. You stay focused on running your company—we handle the clicks, calls, and conversions.
Curious what your roofing business could be getting from paid ads? Let’s find out.
After a quick call, we’ll analyze your service area, top keywords, and monthly search volume—then send you a custom report showing real opportunities for growth.
If your last PPC attempt fell flat, it probably wasn’t the platform—it was the setup.
Here’s what we fix for roofing companies right out of the gate:
  * We organize your account by service and location so your budget goes to the right clicks.
  * Calls and form fills are tracked, so we know exactly what’s working.
  * If the ad says “Free Roof Inspection,” the page needs to say it too—or you’ll lose the lead.
  * We review performance weekly and shift budget toward the top-performers.


Paid ads can work—you just need the right setup and someone who’s watching closely.
Great roofing ads don’t just get seen, they get seen by the people.
We use advanced targeting tools to make sure your ads show up for high-intent homeowners in your service area.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
### Ads that actually get the click + landing pages that win the business
There are terrible Roofing PPC providers out there that don’t even know how to make new pages on your website, and that definitely don’t have 3+ on staff ready to create landing pages for each campaign that is lucrative for you.
We know what it takes to that get massive results for our clients – and we LOVE working with roofers. You need more leads, in a scalable, efficient way that feeds your sales team and creates sustainable growth in revenue. We’re here to help.
Every ad needs a call-to-action, but don’t make it an afterthought. Test out different CTA’s on different ads!
Customers will click on your ad if they TRUST that it will provide them a solution. Examples: certifications, warranties, 5-Star reviews.
What makes your business different from all the other contractors running Google Ads? “#1 Roofer in [city]” is okay to use on occasion, but every roofer says that. What’s can you say that’s unique?
**4. Give them a fast solution with a call-only ad –** People Searching on Google are often looking for fast answers. Give them a fast solution with a Call Only Ad
– What are extensions and how do they work? Essential Extensions for Contractors:
**6. Choose the right keywords and watch how they perform –** Do your research (Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, Spyfu, Semrush) Be aware of the match types.
The #1 Goal with Google Ads is to make MONEY! Numbers to Know
**8. Choose the Right Bidding Strategy For Your Goal –** What is bidding strategy? – Often people want to maximize clicks But you have to work with Google, and tell them what you want them to do with your money.
Check Your Campaigns for Key Performance Indicators. Check Your Search Terms Report Are you getting impressions and clicks for the right keywords?
Make Google like your landing page (relevant to ads and using keywords.) Make Visitors want to fill out your form.
Many roofing PPC agencies copy and paste ads from one client to the next.
This may seem inconsequential at first, but unfortunately, it has serious consequences for the effectiveness of those campaigns.
  * Your company has special qualities that actually make you different from other companies and those facts will actually make the ads more effective.
  * Mistakes can get made, and copy+paste roofing ppc companies end up advertising for things you don’t do. It sounds crazy – but we’ve seen it many times.
  * leads to LAZY THINKING, you want your agency to be thinking critically about every aspect of your campaign, not just lazily rolling out your ads.


It’s not really the copy and paste that is the end of this kind of approach, it’s the whole culture around using the same strategy over and over, without considering the companies differences, their service area and their specialties that make them the most money.
We do completely custom Roofing Google ads, as well as websites and SEO. Think of us as the high-touch, custom roofing marketing company. You may pay a little more than some companies, but when it comes to your digital marketing – trying to pay the least, often means your hard-earned money can be squandered.
Ads are not a place you want to get careless – because the money can be spent so quickly.
## Why choose a website, SEO + PPC focused roofing lead gen agency
That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with Facebook Ads, Angi Leads, or the multitude of shared lead programs out there.
But we want you to have exclusive leads that want to work with your company.
You are not the same as every company on Angi. You are a force to be reckoned with. Roofing leads that come from search are significantly ‘higher intent’ than almost any other source on the planet.
  * You’re not interrupting their social feed with an offer that has nothing to do with what they were looking at.
  * You’re not competing with the 4 other companies that Angi sold the lead to.
  * You’re not wasting money on leads where the source is questionable, or you don’t know exactly how the person found you.


It doesn’t matter how good your offer is on social media, if they didn’t come there to buy.
So the reason they login to an app or go on a particular website, and with search and Google the reason is to FIND SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
So – that’s why we focus so intensely on search engines.
Our first month we spend the time to get to know what makes your company unique as well as the best services to target for maximum ROI. Here’s a brief outline of what you can expect from our team in the first 30 days.








Pricing starts at $2k for budgets under $5000 and scales up from there.
With our PPC services, you will get a monthly reporting call that will give you updates on everything that is going on so you can get a better understanding of what is happening. You are able to get more reporting calls, but it is recommended that you just stick with the one per month, as more are usually not necessary.
If you’ve ever tried PPC but didn’t get the results you were hoping for, we definitely understand. It can be tough to strategize, especially if you don’t know what you’re doing or how you can maximize your efforts.
We take the time to steadily attract the right customers and make sure that your money is being used in the right places giving you the best results for your dollar.
A lot of people will go with the “all-in” approach, which does not necessarily give you the results you want, and could be a giant waste of money if it doesn’t work out. We find what’s working and what isn’t and expand on the parts that are working for your business goals.
##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.

##### Do I Need to Hire a Roofing Niched Website Design Company?
While you could choose to design a website yourself, without any technical expertise, it’s going to be a complicated process and one that will take up to hundreds of hours of your time. On the other hand, we have a team of dedicated professionals who can create a sophisticated website that would be too technical for you to create alone.
The structure of your website is incredibly important. Not only will it help visitors to navigate the site and discover your services, but it also helps you to rank higher in Google. And we know that Google has an overwhelming market share, with the majority of searches happening through their search engine.
If you’re not ranking in Google for your chosen keywords, you’re leaving money on the table. That’s why we design our websites from the ground up with SEO in mind, to ensure that the on-page SEO forms a strong foundation for our future marketing efforts.
We put our clients first, and we take the time to understand their specific business model and the unique needs that they have. That’s why having experience with other roofing and construction companies is such a benefit because we have already put in the hours to discover opportunities in your industry.
Another roofing web design company might primarily have experience designing and marketing websites in the medical fields, and how related is that to roofing?
We understand your business, and we know how the industry works.
We also recognize that most roofers are incredibly busy, spending long days on-site, managing their employees and often doing manual work themselves. They need a company that can get on with the job and who makes cooperating a breeze, rather than a chore.
The last thing that you want as a client is to have to work with a company that is continually requiring your input and guidance, instead, you want to hire professionals that can take the lead but also work cooperatively with you to produce a fantastic website.
##### Is This Going to Bring in More Leads Each Month?
While we make no guarantee, having a website allows you to be visible online. If your current site isn’t representing your business well, potential clients are unlikely to contact you. A new website design will encourage customers to get in contact and to hire you for their roofing needs.
We are extremely honest, and practical – we can help direct you to another , that would be better if we aren’t the right fit.

We spent 3 months putting this together just for contractors – and it’s totally free!
5 preparation days with key mindset things before you start posting.
Is there you or someone on your team that would like to take it? Enter their info (or yours) below!
Curious what’s on the course?Here’s a sneak preview below! 


  1. Hot take – challenge a dominating idea in the industry
  2. Dispel a common myth you see home owners buying into.
  3. Poll people – share the results later (FB, Twitter, LI, Instagram stories)
  4. Make a customer look cool / family pic / tell a story
  5. Have your followers to get something cool (will only work if its an actually good giveaway)


#### Day 1 – Contractor Social Media Course: Create Consistent Themes
This first week we’ll be walking you through SHORT exercises that help prepare you to get the most out of your company’s posts on social media.
Before you just post to your heart’s content to get more business on your company social media accounts – I strongly recommend that you figure out what your company ‘THEMES’ are for your marketing efforts.
  * Remodeler: The you’re going to throw after you finish your kitchen!
  * HVAC Company: You save huge money in the long-run by having a and having a technician come check your systems in spring and fall.


Themes are better when they’re opinionated, related to a pain point of customers – and draw authentically on what your companies REAL STRENGTHS are.
What do people tell your sales people and technicians “Thank God you _________” (example: actually took the time to measure before giving us a quote.) Hammer on the real relief you give customers in comparison to other contractors or home service providers they’ve talked to.
  * that you know appeal to customers based on your own sales experience, or talk to people on the sales team to boil it down to 4 themes you can use to guide your social marketing campaigns like a lantern!


Come to terms with the fact, it’s better to use these themes over and over again (if they actually are good) than to constantly come up with new ones. Keep them loose enough that you can keep on coming back to them. About the time you’re sick of saying something online, that’s about the time it will finally be breaking through to people.
Themes are great – but what actually gets customers to BUY from you.
= “Look at these before and afters – our kitchen would look so gorgeous with these cabinets”
= “My roof is straight up leaking right now… The A/C is out… This landscaping is embarrassing compared to my neighbors.”
Challenger ‘Hook Points’ challenge your ideal customer to think about your services differently – and dig into either pleasure or pain.
In the book ‘The Challenger Sale’ a group of researchers studied the types of salespeople and ‘The Challenger’ was far and away the most successful persuading people to do business with them because ** they REFRAMED the way the prospect was thinking about their services. **
This isn’t just deliberate car salesman tactics – it’s often related to the passion the salesperson feels about THE RIGHT WAY to do things.
So how can you communicate the passion your company has about doing things THE RIGHT WAY on your social media, challenging prospects to think differently.
  * for you to pay for the whole house, but end up with an unusable basement (because it’s unfinished.)
  * Watch out for Angie’s List + HomeAdvisor – as they take big cuts from contractors and drive the quality of service down. Work with highly-vetted, trusted local contractors directly instead!


  * that you can use regularly in your social media campaigns. It’s ok to have righteous anger at people that are ripping homeowners off – it’s ok to challenge the way it’s always been done in your industry.


Talk with your best salespeople and the owner of the company (if you’re not them) to ensure you’re on the right track. Have them read this e-mail to get more context on what a ‘Challenger Viewpoint’ is if it’s useful!
One challenger view point I have is: It’s really important for you as a marketing manager (if you’re not the owner of a company) to have AUTONOMY & FREEDOM to post on the company social accounts. So if you don’t have that trust with the person that could veto something – go talk to them today, and get their trust and try to get autonomy to post freely (having the company’s best interests at heart.) Great ROI on social media can quickly go south, if every post requires a second eyes for approval – online, stuff moves fast. As long as you’re kind, and smart – the person who makes the final decisions should be cool with you having “freedom to play” + post regularly with constant approvals and back and forth (which can turn into time-wasting.)
#### Day 3 – Contractor Social Media Course: 10 Content + Referral Partners
You’ve created 4 themes + 3 challenger view points to use on your social accounts. You don’t have to stick to ONLY those topics, just think of them like the chorus of the song… or the refrain that you keep coming back to.
Now you need other players for your band! On social media, I love to think of our referral partners as content creation partners as well.
  1. How could you be useful to them by featuring them on a video, or promoting their services on your social accounts. Do consider whether they also are active on social and can be part of the fun.
  2. Think about the service providers that also work with homeowners like your best customers. If you’re a roofer that doesn’t do gutters or soft washing – those could be the first two. Otherwise branch out further – landscapers, realtors, public adjusters, remodelers, hardscapers. Whatever you do – look for adjacent service providers that you could feature on your page, and get great insights from to feature in your content.


Write a list of 10 service providers that have or could refer you business! If you need to pick the brain of the sales team, or a company leader do that now, or set a half hour in the calendar to do that.
Google if you need to, recognize small to mid-sized businesses are often better at referring than huge ones who have corporate rules for much of that stuff.
Next to each of your possible referral/content partners – put a “Next Step:” and say whether your next step is to email, call and introduce yourself, or if your companies are already acquainted – set up a 30 minute call to brainstorm topics for a joint video, or to film a video showcasing something that would be useful to your audience.
Just showing up and filming a “look at this service” video might not be interesting enough to your audience.
  1. Try to make it something that would be really useful, like DIY tips, maintenance tips, or something entertaining.
  2. Make sure the thumbnail makes the company featuring look cool and professional. (As cool as you can make it.) Don’t get caught up here – DOING IT, is better than being perfect on all this stuff and waiting months to get started.
  3. Promote the heck out of the video once it goes live on 2-3 of your best social channels. Tag them, tag individuals if you can not just the company, and if you need to put $100 bucks in Facebook promotion dollars toward making it blow up as much as it can.


The key is – we want that referral partner to think of you as an ALLY.
Not just a cute little referral partner, but someone they want on their side.
Someone that they want to promote as well, someone that is worth referring more business to.
Rinse and repeat 10 times over this next year with different amazing referral partners in your area.
Maybe you need to try doing this with 20-30 people, but in the end – working with 10 companies more than once, and long-term that you’ve determined can refer real business is one of the best ways to drive business that is available to us as marketers.
#### Day 4 – Contractor Social Media Course: Bigger Market Inspiration
The first thing we do when we start marketing oftentimes is look at the closest ‘competitors’ we think matter in our market.
We Google them… we sometimes think we can beat them.
We sometimes get intimidated by them… but the shine wears off, they stop looking so cool to us.
We know too much. We care too much – and discount everything they do in their marketing, we don’t really want to be like them anymore. And it’s probably good – because if you just copy people in YOUR MARKET, people won’t be able to see the DIFFERENCE, and we want to be DIFFERENT than other people so there’s a clear reason to choose to buy from us.
If you’re a roofer in Duluth, Minnesota – hunt for one badass roofing company in Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles to study and take inspiration from (or whatever other markets.)
Find 5 contractors in bigger markets that actually are crushing it on their social media channels, their website, videos, and blogs – to try to take big inspiration from. Don’t settle for “decent” – keep hunting til you find 5 amazing ones and follow them on every social channel.
Note one thing you’d like to try on your content + social media, and keep a little running R&D list. If you’re ever struggling to find topics, take inspiration from them! mnm
You know what makes coming up with topics for content soooo much easier?!
Keyword research. Consistently doing keyword research around what people are searching on Google and Youtube, will help you understand the CONTENT DEMAND, and help you find topics you’re audience will love.
Just pull up SemRush.com, or Ahrefs.com and pop in competitors (or contractors in bigger markets) to see what blogs they have that are getting a lot of traffic.
You can also ‘guess’ topics by searching them on Google – and taking the top couple results and putting those URL’s into SemRush or Ahrefs and see what THEY’RE REALLY RANKING FOR.
Why do these keywords / phrases matter? If you put those phrases that have a lot of ‘search volume’ towards the beginning of your video or blog titles, you’re more likely to show up when people are actually searching.
Find 20 Keywords that contain topics you could do posts or videos about! Look at competitors, take some some guesses, and put the URL for the top ranking result in the tools, and use your own creativity and the data to get a list going.
This should be a weekly or monthly habit to continually refresh your list – and your research here will inform your sensibility about the types of topics people are looking for more generally as well. The more you do it, the better your radar will be.
Blend this approach in with the other approaches you’ve learned so far, and use them for the upcoming prompts (next week!) Get ready to start posting – we’re so close! 
If you don’t have access yet, get access to the social media accounts, and do a or Photoshop of a before and after.
That’s it! If you have access to a before picture – go get one today on a job that hasn’t started yet, AND post a picture of a completed project. Get out of the office! The more time you spend away from your desk in marketing like this, the better results you usually will have.
Make it aesthetic – and have fun! Here are a few other tips to drive engagement:
  * Ask a question people will actually respond to: “Open or closed kitchen?!” etc. Lead with the question to get people involved. The more people comment on that picture, the better it will show up in other people’s feeds.
  * Keep it relaxed, recognize no-one really cares that much, so it’s going to be more about volume (not really about any one post.)


Comment on and like 3 other peoples’ posts, and follow 10 people on your companies top 3 platforms.
I’m not going to say this every day, but realistically don’t expect hardcore results from this course, if you’re not commenting, liking and connecting with new people on these platforms every day. **That’s the game, involve yourself – it’s a 2-way conversation, not a megaphone!**
#### Day 7 – Contractor Social Media Course: In Progress Shot
Finished work is great, but people love to see the process!
Post a photo that shows someone from your team working on something cool. Whether that’s someone digging gravel, installing some insulation, or sawing wood – hype up your teammate.
What’s going on in the world of [your niche] today?
Pool Installers – 23% increase in pool installations this past year
HVAC – In-door air quality demand surges because of COVID.
Go to the news blog websites for your industry to look for interesting surges in the market.
But always remember – most homeowners don’t care if it’s super “Us focused” so spin it in such away that it’s about them.
Feel free to link off to the blog article that gives more context – often though, I post a picture related to it, and sum up the article in 2-3 paragraphs or perhaps bullet points, then say “link in comments.”
Because the social media algorithms don’t want people to leave their platform so they often play down posts that link directly in the post.
To me – industry news is something to post about every 2-4 weeks, and not all the time. Mix it in, and you seem like the authority on your services.
#### Day 9 – Contractor Social Media Course: An Award You Won
So today – share an award the company has won and express gratitude for the opportunity.
Don’t just post the raw PNG of the award per say, you can use Canva.com to put a dark or colored overlay on a picture of a great project your company completed, then put the award over the top of it. This way it feels branded, and integrated with the rest of your social media feed.
If the company is super new – sign up for BBB – the default level is A+ for companies, and you can use that on social. Feel free to wait on this one if you absolutely have to and don’t have an award, but try to post today if you can.
Well it’s true – the “customer is the hero” of the story here – smart customers hire a company like yours so make them feel smart by sharing this with a tone of gratitude.
Don’t be too cheesy about it, but share if there was criteria that they were basing the award on, and if there were any other suppliers or contractors that collaborated with you on that project tag them!
#### Day 10 – Contractor Social Media Course: Giveaway or Contest
Whether it’s a branded yeti cooler, a fishing pole and tackle, or a Free Gutter Cleaning – I want you to try to give something away. Take a picture of it, or post a related picture and then say – In celebration of spring… or in celebration of our new maintenance program (or whatever you choose) WIN [the item] just comment, and like this post and tag a friend you’d like to share it with! (or something cheeky here)
Share more about the SERVICE you’re trying to promote – and have a fun and playful tone.
Yes! This type of thing costs money, so you’ll want to do these few and far between, but if you can find something that’s both super cool to giveaway (that people want,) and that isn’t super expensive – it can be a great way to get algorithmic favor.
Respond to every comment with an emoji or something on every platform (good general rule) even if it feels redundant.
#### Day 11 – Contractor Social Media Course: A Day in The Field
Have someone (a sales person, a carpenter, or a technician, for instance) let you shadow them for half a day, and have them do whatever they normally do.
Then just take the occasional video, or photo. Posting them on Instagram and Facebook stories with a funny hashtag or something (Ex. #TagalongTuesday.)
**I always say nothing is boring, if you look at it close enough.** That’s a good approach to a half day tagalong. Ask good questions – use this opportunity to find out more about the intricacies of that position, and yes, at the end of it you want to make them look kind of cool, and the company look good.
  * Checking out a problem, or working through an issue on-site.
  * Asking them about their job, driving around in the truck.


I strongly suggest making getting out of the office a habit, because everything’s more interesting when you’re on an adventure. And everything’s easier to understand when someone DEMONSTRATES it in real life, ‘on the job.’
The more you can make this kind of content part of your life, the more engaging it will be in compared to those dead videos back at the office.
You’re in an industry (construction or home services) where there’s an abundance of visuals and interesting things people are doing. Capture it on video, and get on the move with your other teammates!
Perhaps you’re part of one of those companies that has the history plastered on the wall in the office, or perhaps the company is more recent and there’s barely a history yet – but today’s challenge is to share a piece of that history.
I think zooming in on one component will be the easiest way to make this feel like a ‘human interest piece.’ Examples:
  * A picture of the original office where it all started.
  * The founder by themself, vs. The founder with a big team around them.
  * A early job that you completed, and a little story about that.
  * A long-time customer and why they worked with the company when it was smaller.


No matter what – don’t use this as a promotion as much as… use it as a little story about the passage of time, gratefulness, or how things change.
Make it fun, and don’t assume everyone cares about the company – but they might ‘see themselves in the story’ of growth and self-discovery.
#### Day 13 – Contractor Social Media Course: Challenge The Industry
Today I’m asking that you share a ‘Hot Take’ / that you make the post you put out a little ‘spicy.’
Well – I basically want you to post something that you know someone will probably disagree with.
You see – we often have ‘challenging’ thoughts towards the industry that we don’t share because we’re scared people will Disagree With Online™️ (Heaven forbid)
But if we’re honest with our audience – these posts can make for some of the best content you put out (because they’re interesting, take a stance, and actually stand for something) – a few examples:
  * It’s just plain wrong to re-use flashing if you’re a roofing company, unfortunately some do to cut corners, watch out for this.
  * It’s better to have your contractor be part of your plans phase – because then they can share if something is logistically difficult earlier, or will increase the cost.


I want you to challenge the industry, and post a ‘hot take.’
Sure – make sure it aligns with your company leadership’s real opinion, but don’t back down.
This is going to be fun. (Expect haters – and be ok with it.)
#### Day 14 – Contractor Social Media Course: Trick of The Trade
Today is simple – ask people or (if you’re a contractor / or the owner of a company) share one of your ‘tricks of the trade.’
Do you have a way to cut trim down super easily?
Do you have a trick for anything that you think would interest homeowners, or that you share anyways in person a lot?
Share that! Make a little short video showing the #lifehack, and share it on Instagram, Facebook, and hell – even tick-tock!
#### Day 15 – Contractor Social Media Course: Client Testimonial Video
This one may take a little more planning, but either way – get the ball rolling today.
Get a client testimonial video. These have to be the #1 most important video to your marketing efforts, they can then be re-used on many future videos or clips for social in the future.
Ask a customer that had a great experience if you can set a time to come out and interview them, and if they’d just be honest.
Set up the camera off to the side, and ask them questions about stuff that’s unrelated first – ”How long have you been in the house,” etc. etc. and then slowly transition to their experience with the company “What did you like about working with [our company]” and then edit out the questions, and focus on the customer in the final edit.
While you’re there get footage of the finished job, and splice those clips in over the audio of them sharing their experience.
If you’re not familiar with video – check out our guide to getting started! Your iphone on its side is serviceable – it’s not about having perfect equipment, as much as it is about getting good content.
#### Day 16 – Contractor Social Media Course: Who is Inspiring You?
I believe following 5-10 awesome pages that you want your page to be like regularly can really help you stay ‘swimming in great content,’ which will give context and color to your content.
So if you’re not doing that yet – do that (on your personal profile, and the company page) and post about someone who is really inspiring you / the company. What are they doing that’s so great for the community, or what work are they doing that’s amazing?
2 tones on social media that will never go out of style: Gratefulness, and Praise.
#### Day 17 – Contractor Social Media Course: Share a Recent Blog Post
Sometimes blog articles are more for ‘SEO’ / getting found on search, and some are more appealing as a post to put out on your social media channels as well. Go find a recent blog post (or write one!) on your website that is in line with your core brand themes, and tell the audience why they should read it.
Sometimes that’s giving a little excerpt and leaving off on a cliff hanger, sometimes thats including an infographic with a few key points from the article, and sometimes that’s ‘leading with the problem’ that the piece of content helps solve to get their attention – and giving an overview of what they can expect if they take the time to read it.
Not everyone clicks through – but by sharing content from your site, you are positioning yourself as a thought leader and a useful company. It’s really about the rhythm of doing this once or twice a week that has compounding benefits over the long-haul, and you’ll get better at getting people excited to click, with experimentation and doing it regularly.
#### Day 18 – Contractor Social Media: Finished Projects / Glamour Shots
Maybe your company does *aesthetic* / good looking work, and you know exactly what to post. Do that now! Glamour shots are a big piece to how many contractors catch people’s interest as they consider this type of work #lifegoals!
We work with a ton of ‘non-aesthetic’ trades as well – and what I will say, it’s still worth it to post finished work. Trends online that may relate: People love ‘Things arranged neatly’, and there’s even dedicated to making these kinds of photos. Also – some of the process is ‘satisfying’ people like to see a clean line of nails go in – or something dirty get clean, anything that gives that feeling of completion.
Use what you’ve got – and spend a little time getting a great photo, or a great little video. Just remember, people have short attention spans – they don’t care about you – they care about some little nugget of value or entertainment for their lives, in this moment.
Show off new swag – with a company culture post! Show 3 technicians in their matching Polo’s or branded mugs that you’re giving out to clients, or whatever SWAG that you’re really proud of.
I love ‘swag’ as a way to get the word out about products and services, but it also can be great fodder for social media, as it demonstrates a certain amount of legitimacy and pride in your brand.
So take a picture of swag in action, and don’t forget to try to include a smiling face in the shot! 
Going to be at a trade show, a country music festival, an event where industry speakers will be, or any other event. Whether you’re attending, exhibiting, speaking or just there with a few teammates, post on social! If you don’t have any at the moment, find one that would make sense to show up to.
Get out there – take pictures with adjacent service providers, and remember – marketing is not just about getting new leads, but about making new connections and sometimes stoking referral partnerships.
If you don’t have an event today – RSVP for one today, and post about it on social telling other people you and your company will be there representing!
#### Day 21 – Contractor Social Media Course: Highlight a Teammate
If your company’s most valuable resource is your people… why not share a picture of one of them today, and what they mean to the team?
I like to get a picture of them smiling or hard at work – and pen a little appreciation post to go along with it. You can do these probably max once or twice a month without exhausting the audience, but it’s a great way to involve your people and share a little excitement.
Once again – do your best to make it fun, and not boring. Tap the people that work closely with them, and ask “what makes this person a great teammate” and share those things, or share a funny fact and their interests. Make your team feel human through this! Just sharing our humanity is actually great for the business.
#### Day 22 – Contractor Social Media Course: Cultural Moment (video)
What a better way to capture attention than to co-opt a surge in attention towards a cultural moment. Examples:
  1. During a surge in crypto: “You’ll invest in crypto-currency – but not in improving the home you’re in every day?” 
  2. “During the flooding in Louisiana – we’re giving 20% off of waterproofing services, this week only.”
  3. Start of fishing season – “Fishing opener this weekend! What’s your favorite lake to fish on?” – with a picture of a team member fishing in your company’s logo apparel.


This method is endless – because it doesn’t assume they care about your company. All it does is allow you to branch out and talk about what’s going on in the world.
Just get better over time about clicking into what your audience actually responds to – and come with some refreshing perspective, or something funny to get the conversation started. You don’t want to just ‘announce’, you want to get some back and forth going ideally.
#### Day 23 – Contractor Social Media Course: Design a Testimonial
Grab a snippet from a really nice review on your Google My Business or Facebook page and turn it into a nice looking design, using Photoshop or Canva. If you’re good at design use Photoshop – otherwise there’s no shame in using a pre-built template in Canva.com, and swapping out the colors and fonts to match your brand.
#### Day 24 – Contractor Social Media Course: Share a Meme
Today – I’m suggesting to follow 10 meme accounts that focus on your industry on Instagram!
Look through them for 20 minutes (like and comment if you want), but find one that’s epic or hilarious and re-share it on your account, giving credit back to where you found it or the original creator.
Ideally – you’re not ‘self-roasting’ too hard – but that you find something that reminds your audience of their need for the service, or the problem with hiring a low-quality provider. Shoot for relatable, and not too hard to understand.
#### Day 25 – Contractor Social Media Course: Feature a Referral Partner (video)
Who has been sending you a ton of referrals lately?
Feature them on your social today! Share a picture of them doing really cool work (or a picture of them with you or your company owner) and why they are good at what they do.
Tag them – try to do it at the best time of day to get a lot of interaction. Perhaps even consider boosting the post, sharing it on personal accounts etc. because it will raise the profile of your company with that referral partner. It will help them realize that you care very much about that partnership.
Many times when I post I throw it into our Slack (internal communication system) and ask people to like and comment to increase engagement. Feel a little phoney? I don’t care – it works! By driving up the algorithmic engagement, more people will see your post and more people will come to know your company.
So try that for this post – and give it a little bit of an extra advantage to help drive the point home to your referral partner (that it’s nice to be associated with your company), for many reasons – including your efforts on social media.
#### Day 26 – Contractor Social Media Course: Highlight Specific Product
Today – I want you to highlight a specific product on your social media. Whether you love Marvin Windows, LP Smartside Siding, or a particular type of sink – zoom in on a company and product that your company swears by.
Ideally you can be honest, sharing pro’s and con’s – but generally being positive, because I want you to tag the manufacturer in the post and hype them up a bit.
Funny enough – I’ve seen this strategy net contractors free product, or higher priority in their manufacturer’s rep’s queue. Wield your influence on social to get better deals! But your number one goal here is to be useful to your customers, and introduce them to products (that you are great at installing, or working with!)
#### Day 27 – Contractor Social Media Course: Super Easy DIY Tips
Today – talk to people on your team to share a ‘super easy ‘do-it-yourself’ tip in the form of a ‘story’ on social. If you’re on Tik-tok there, because they have great ‘creator tools’ to make making step by step content easy – otherwise just do it on Instagram or Facebook stories.
  * What’s a fun little tip that your technician often shows to home-owners or property managers? – or
  * What do they wish every homeowner or property manager knew about maintaining their home or building? – or
  * What’s something they get called out for a lot that’s actually relatively simple and that homeowners can do themselves?


Once you have that – just make it into a quick and entertaining 1 minute – 3 step video, and put it out on your company stories! If you did it on Tik-tok, export the video and share it on Instagram and Facebook as well.
I talk to a lot of contractors – and I always hear some variation of:
“We keep on saying the same thing to a lot of customers” – often relating to current trends / and style.
Share a style opinion in the form of a video or a little graphic today! Examples:
  * Farmhouse ‘Barn Doors’ are out of style – do this instead


You have style – now get out there and share it. First step is finding a style perspective with the help of your team, or your own experience, and the second step here is making a piece of content that asserts that opinion (the more specific the better!)
It’s style – so people can disagree. Or you can ask it as a question – the great part is, either way, you get more comments from a post like this.
#### Day 29 – Contractor Social Media Course: Dispel a Myth
What myth do you see home owners or property managers buying into?
Today – create a post on why that’s not true. Perhaps bullet point all of the reasons why it’s not true, and see if you can find compelling image to accompany your myth-busting.
#### Day 30 – Contractor Social Media Course: Interview Someone (video)
It’s time to get out of the office! This time, to someone who is in a related business. Ask someone if they wouldn’t mind you asking a few questions about what they do – and why it’s important.
If you’re a landscaping company – interview a tree service company owner.
So on – and so forth, but along your travels you get all kinds of questions about adjacent things, your job is to act like an investigative journalist digging up all the interesting stuff that surrounds what you do.
Do you think it’s too boring? Nothing is boring if you look closely enough. Be fascinated, be intrigued, be a listener – and your audience will be too. Make the person you’re interviewing feel cool, and give your audience the inside scoop today!
#### Day 31 – Contractor Social Media Course: Conduct a Poll
Instagram, Linkedin and Facebook all have options for polls – so put out a poll on social today, because they get great engagement.
  * Instagram Stories only allows two options on the poll so you might have to modify your approach there. Yes, No type questions.
  * Linkedin basically counts every vote almost like a “like” in it’s algorithm, so polls are featured prominently when you post them.
  * You want your poll to be ‘accessible’ meaning – most people will have an opinion on it, don’t make it something too obscure.


If you – like me, have a lot of success with posting polls – this might be something that you can do on a weekly or at least monthly basis.
#### Day 32 – Contractor Social Media Course: Ask for Referrals (video)
That’s right, put out a text post with a picture… or shoot a short video that says something a long the lines of. “We’re so grateful for your referrals – please keep them coming. Could you connect us with ONE person THIS WEEK that could use our services? As a small business we depend on folks like you that spread the word about our dedication to customer service and our commitment to quality. Thank you! Whenever you hear someone in need of [OUR SERVICE] think of us, and let them know we’d love to help.”
This is something you can do once a quarter – and it’s not desperate, it’s smart. Even if we aren’t in need of a ton of new business at the moment, we keep our pipeline healthy when we make our marketing more about REFERRALS than just trying to create 5x leads for the week or whatever our goal is.
#### Day 33 – Contractor Social Media: Make a Customer Look Cool (video)
Today – post a picture, or tell a story, that makes a customer look cool or look smart.
“This customer advocated for themselves with their insurance company and got their roof completely for.”
“This customer chose this absolutely gorgeous banana leaf print wallpaper to go along with their wet bar and made their basement into a cabana.”
The whole idea is making the customer into the hero of the story. Your company is just the guide!
Have a bit more of a complex idea that the owner or a key person on the team wants to explain? Have them explain it with a whiteboard!
I like to take a little bit of time, and draw 3 icons up on the whiteboard to explain my top 3 key points, and then either write in the 3 main points as I do the video, or do those before I start as well.
Then in 2-3 minutes explain the concept in as simplified way as they possibly can – so that homeowners can follow along.
The key here is to choose a topic that a homeowner will be excited about and interested in. (Lead with their pain point, and how this video will help solve it.)
#### Day 35 – Contractor Social Media Course: Post a Thank you video
Post a thank you video to someone who’s help you or the company achieve something awesome.
Personally – I want to say, CONGRATULATIONS! If you posted every day for the past 6 weeks – you’ve probably learned a ton about what DOES and what DOESN’T work. If you’d like a badge / certificate of completion. E-mail me at and say ‘I posted every day for 6 weeks” – and I’ll check your work, and send you the CONTRACTOR SOCIAL MEDIA certificate if you finished.
“We know what it takes to help get home service businesses more leads with Google. Even if we’re not the right fit, we’ll get you where you need to go.”

Marketing solar isn’t like marketing just any service. Your customers are making a major investment — and they need to trust you from the first click.
At Hook Agency, we specialize in home services and have deep experience helping solar companies grow. We know what moves the needle:


You don’t need a generalist agency. You need a partner who understands how to get real, qualified leads for solar — and who has the results to back it up.
### How We Drive Solar Leads That Actually Turn Into Sales
Not all marketing leads are created equal — especially in the solar world.
You don’t just need more form fills or phone calls. You need homeowners who are serious about investing in solar, and ready to move forward. That’s where Hook Agency shines.
We build strategies focused on — using SEO, PPC, and landing page design to attract the right people at the right time:
  * : We target keywords buyers actually search for like “best solar installers near me,” “solar panel installation cost,” and “solar tax credit 2025” — not just vanity terms.
  * : Our solar ads focus on education, cost savings, and trust factors to pull in motivated buyers, not tire kickers.
  * : Every page is designed to filter and qualify leads naturally, getting you higher-quality conversations and fewer dead-end calls.


By aligning your marketing strategy with real buyer behavior, we help solar companies like yours get more valuable leads — and close more deals.
Solar marketing isn’t just about traffic or clicks. It’s about filling your pipeline with people ready to to solar.
There are plenty of marketing companies out there. So why Hook?

  * : Unlike agencies who split their time across industries, we go deep on solar, roofing, and home improvement marketing.
  * : No cookie-cutter templates. We craft plans that match your local market, your goals, and your growth stage.
  * : You’ll get live dashboards, monthly strategy check-ins, and a team that’s constantly pushing to get better results — not just setting and forgetting.
  * : Our case studies speak for themselves — higher rankings, more leads, and real revenue growth for solar companies.


At the end of the day, we care about one thing: . If you’re ready for a team that treats your marketing like it’s their own — and pushes just as hard as you do — you’re in the right place.
Because of the level of attention and expertise we bring, we’re not the cheapest option — and that’s by design.
[Check out this quick video on _why we charge more — and why it’s worth it._]
Choosing the right solar marketing partner is a big decision. We believe you should know exactly what you’re getting — and what kind of value you can expect from day one.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.

If you’re serious about getting your company to the next level and getting the leads that you need to grow your business, send us a message and learn more about how we can help get you there.
### If you decide to do your solar SEO in-house – here are 5 tips:
  * Keyword research is your best friend – I like to Google the thing I *THINK* people are searching and then take the top result and put that URL into Ahrefs or SEMRush (SEO Tools) to see what it’s ranking for that has real search volume – then create content around that.
  * Creating content should be at least a weekly rhythm – Your internal team should become a quality content machine, if you’re going the internal route. Learning ‘On-page’ SEO, and rolling those principles into every piece of content you put out.
  * Make sure thin + duplicate content is de-indexed and your site is fast – On WordPress a tool like RankMath can help you do the de-indexing, and WP Fastest Cache or Autoptimize can help you speed it up. Just expect to do some granular changes on the settings and make sure nothing broke as you tweak them!
  * Get links back to the site with guest-posting at a steady pace – Amazing tools like No BS Marketplace, and OutreachMama can help you scale this without doing manual outreach – but you’ll want to mix in a bit of Press Release, Local directories, and other tactics and only link to blog posts for the most part (with a few links to landing pages with exact match keywords – but be careful!)
  * Monitor on a monthly basis and re-visit winning (*and underperforming content) – This (and internal linking) are two of the most overlooked solar SEO tactics. Add new content, and look at Search Console for other terms the page or post is ranking for to increase the amount of good stuff (images, videos, written content) and make tweaks to the way the keyword is prioritized on headlines, alt tags, and meta titles + descriptions.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
##### How are you different from other Solar marketing + lead generation companies?
  * We actually get the work done for you. We are 100% lead generation focused, and do more content + links in the first 3-6 months than most solar marketing companies do in a year.
  * We have case studies on case studies of successful marketing campaigns + lead generation case studies for home services businesses.


SEO is the process of how we get your pages to rank at the top of the Google results pages. When people search phrases like “solar company” you want to appear at the top. This way you will bring in more traffic to your site, educate them on the products and services that you offer and convert them into paying customers.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
SEO is amazing for getting leads in 6-9 months from the start of your project, but PPC can help you get more leads tomorrow – and the next day, and feed your sales team for the foreseeable future. We’re of the mind that if you can afford to do both and you need to see immediate results, you should start PPC as soon as possible.
PPC ads are a nice strategy to implement if you are looking for quick results. Your content gets put to the top of the search results, but has a downside to it as well. When you stop paying for this, you will stop seeing results right away. Thats is why this is a good pairing with SEO so you could see results before the SEO takes off.

  *   *   * 

When it comes to showing off the quality of the work your company does, it is very tough. This is why having a website that does this is so important and will help earn the trust of those visiting your website. 
  * Get a website that you are actually able to make edits on. 


We have monitored the analytics on 100’s of contractors websites and know what drives people to take action. We build in trust factors, and persuasive images and headlines to drive leads.
Where website design + combine to bring in the right people right when they’re searching. That’s our speciality – we build the site with SEO in mind from the beginning.
We know some people don’t read. We skip to the point right when they land on the website to give them a reason to contact you right away, or at least let them know the point of the website from the outset.
### We make sure that the websites we make are built for lead generation and get conversions


### Solar Website Design that will generate more leads for your business
When it comes to getting people to convert on your website, you not only need to have one, but you need one that represents the quality of work that you do.
Think about it for a second. If you have a website that is old and outdated, hard to navigate, and unclear of where to go, it is going to be extremely hard for you to convert people onto your site.
A bad solar website design can actually send people running the other way and make it incredibly hard for you to earn their trust and think that your business performs quality work.
### Solar website design that gets you the results you want
When you want to grow your business, you can’t do that unless you get more leads and are able to close them.
We help you to do this through our high-caliber solar website design processes and make sure that we differentiate the differences between your business and the pesky competitor that we all know you’re better than.
Our websites are also super easy for you to edit on the backend as well which is something that seems like a rarity these days. We want you to be able to handle this and be in charge of your marketing so you don’t need to be dependent on us for simple adds and changes you want done.
We take more accountability & responsibility than is necessary or comfortable. We act like we own the company when we make decisions.
When challenges come up, we not only maintain a positive attitude, but have fun and use it as an opportunity to improve.

##### Do I Need to Hire a Solar Website Design Company?
This all depends on the stage of the game your solar company is in. If you don’t have much of a budget to work with, then it wouldn’t make sense for you to drop a chunk of change on a website. There are other areas that could help you more at that time of your business.
However, if you are more tenured and have the budget for a premium site and have taken care of the other important areas of marketing, then you should look towards a professional agency that produces high-quality work.
##### How are you different from other Solar marketing + lead generation companies?
  * We actually get the work done for you. We are 100% lead generation focused, and do more content + links in the first 3-6 months than most solar marketing companies do in a year.
  * We have case studies on case studies of successful marketing campaigns + lead generation case studies for home services businesses.


Absolutely not! Have you ever heard the saying you get what you pay for? Because that saying stands true with solar website design.
When you go with the cheap route, you will get a website that is only going to last you 1, maybe two years, and be right back to where you started. These cheap sites are also not going to be as conversion-focused and won’t bring you the leads a more experienced and professional designer could.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.






##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.
##### Do you help with making sure the website ‘converts’ traffic too?
We use a custom dashboard for your business to monitor our success, and the dashboard focuses on our next steps, and **the actual amount of contact form submissions, phone calls or e-commerce sales** that a client receives for the month.
We love helping clients determine what a lead from their website is worth so there is accountability, transparency, and understanding of the R.O.I. that comes from our services. We insist on this and we thrive off of it. It’s not uncommon for companies to come away from the first couple months working with us with a much deeper understanding of how their website converts visitors into leads and what that means for their bottom line. We love this – and learn a ton from each of our clients as well.
We love working with smart entrepreneurs, small business owners, and marketing directors – and would love an opportunity to chat with you about your business and what could do for you. Contact us now.
Compelling imagery, clean design and many reasons to trust you, with clear call to actions are huge.
As long as these things or there, the next biggest piece is making sure the website is search engine optimized – by including 500-700 words on each key page, having a sitemap, writing meta titles and descriptions and getting links to your website – we also know how to increase your Google traffic and get you to the top search results after a website is built. Our New York Web Design services will help you get more leads on a website you’re proud of.

## Water Damage and Restoration SEO that is fully dedicated to bringing you more leads
When it comes to leads, you don’t just want more of them, but you want the right ones as well. When you are getting leads that aren’t a fit for your business, it can be a big waste of both time and money for your business.
When you do SEO with us, you will get more of those qualified leads that you are looking for and less of the ones that are taking up your salesman’s time.

Having a website is a great first step for your business, but if there is never anyone coming to your site, then what good is it doing for you? You could have the greatest website in the world but if you aren’t able to get anyone to land on it, then it isn’t doing you any good.

Hook Agency has been doing water damage SEO for 5+ years, starting with a ServiceMaster franchise, and now working with foundation repair, tons of roofing companies and other home services businesses.

That being said – companies that choose us say they like that we have:
  * Monthly reporting and clarity on exactly what we did that month.
  * We have in-house writers and SEO’s doing the work for you.
  * We have a live marketing dashboard, and a human being sorting leads + listening to calls to qualify what is a real lead and what is not.


Your SEO doesn’t just happen by accident. Sure – you might blog every once in a while, or get a shout out from a local news channel website and it could help.
But the real money-maker is diligent monthly execution is monthly strategies, but we don’t just want you to hire our because you don’t know how it works. We give everything away on , and aren’t scared to teach.

  4. Build out content for those terms. Example: a ‘Water Mitigation Services in City Name’ page, and a ‘Basement Waterproofing Product Reviews’ or anything in between for people at different stages of the buyers journey / sales funnel.
  5. Get links from other websites back to your website. This can be with ‘Local directory listings‘, ‘‘, ‘‘, and even with a tool called ‘Help a Reporter Out.’
  6. Regularly look at what’s working and double down on your best pages, and continue to build out your opportunity pages.


## Don’t waste your money on cheap water damage SEO companies
Seriously, generally beneath the 2k a month amount, you’d be better off spending your money on the above strategies or having someone on your team learn this.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








And as such, it’s the most valuable for clients of ours that sell something that really has a high-profit margin, and perhaps a high price tag – that doesn’t mean the local dry cleaners can’t benefit from SEO as well. It might be quicker to use SEO to get to the top of Google for dry-cleaning services, but harder and longer to get to the top of Google for wealth-advising, luxury home building or other higher margin, higher value terms.
This doesn’t mean it’s not worth it to rank, in fact, the opposite is true – but it may mean there is thicker competition because of the high reward for ranking in these categories. Nonetheless, we love helping companies in an ongoing, aggressive, and sustained effort to keep your company at the top of Google results – our SEO Services can be custom-tailored to your unique needs while implementing our systematic, consistently effective approach that has worked for many other companies.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.
##### Am I at a point where SEO is worth it, and I should hire an agency?
This decision is entirely up to you. It does depend on your flexibility, motivation to learn, and the depth of your website Backed by your research, you could implement basic SEO strategies yourself. But you could also uncover a powerful strategy with the help of an expert.

Hands down, digital marketing is the most cost-efficient way to get real, effective results. With effective digital marketing, you can build your brand and generate leads without breaking the bank.
Google ranks your website in large part based on the quantity and quality of links leading back to it from off-page. That makes it clear why effective digital marketing is imperative in helping to grow your business. Further, you need to understand how to utilize keywords effectively—the terms potential leads will use to try to search for your business.
All of that is a very complicated process. But at Hook Agency, we’ve spent years mastering it—we know precisely what works and what doesn’t. Contact us to discuss your company’s business objectives, and we’ll get right to work developing a specific strategy to help you execute them.
We take more accountability & responsibility than is necessary or comfortable. We act like we own the company when we make decisions.
When challenges come up, we not only maintain a positive attitude, but have fun and use it as an opportunity to improve.
We’re always looking for more efficient and productive ways to do things. We’re able to do more with less & we turn constraints into inspiration.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
Well, that is a question that only you can really answer. If it’s been over 5-7 years, then it might be time for you to start looking and see what the market has to offer and see if it is the right decision for your business.
When you’re making your decision, just remember this – when you have an old and outdated site, there is going to be a lack of trust from your site’s visitors and could possibly send them running to the competition.
Each ‘Content Management System’ is like a type of car – you wouldn’t try to buy a Toyota from a Porsche dealership. requires some specialization as well – and we’ve worked on for many years now, learning the ins and outs of it while finding ways to be more efficient than my competitors. I’ve seen people sell a client Magento (a content management system) because they knew they could get a better margin on it – **even when the client could’ve had an extremely effective website with WordPress + WooCommerce**. I honestly want you to have a website you can make changes on yourself and get the most effective solution for a reasonable price.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.

##### Do my PPC results last even after I’m done paying?
No, the minute you stop paying for your PPC ads, that is when they stop. It is not like SEO where you will continue to see results after you stop with the work and putting money towards it.
It is kind of like a billboard, except in a digital form where you pay for a certain amount of time so it is seen, and then when you stop paying, it is taken down.
We like the slow and steady approach, but SEO takes that concept to an extreme. While SEO is important, it takes several months to see a return on the investment. On the other hand, PPC scores leads quickly, like tomorrow!
Ultimately, a combination of strong SEO with an efficient PPC campaign provides a balanced approach. If you can afford to do both, you can have the best of both worlds.
When you first start off your SEO campaign, you will have a few months of waiting before you start to see results. This is where PPC can come in handy. When you can afford to do both, you can start your SEO campaign and also start your PPC campaign to get things started while you are waiting for your SEO to take off and kick into full gear.
So, to sum things up, if you have the funds in your marketing budget, then you may find benefits in getting both of these.

##### What makes you different from other Window and Doors marketing companies?
There are things that we do those other agencies just don’t do or don’t do as well. We get high authority backlinks (because those are the ones that work best) that help boost your Google rankings. We also do monthly reporting on how things are going and provide you with a live marketing dashboard so you can see your year-over-year increase in traffic to your site, leads, and contacts that you receive about your business.
We typically have a 100-day timeline and are looking to bring that timeline down. We do custom design and development so that you get the website your company needs. There are other companies out there that take a more simple but less effective route with their websites through themes or cutting corners, but these aren’t worth the cheaper price that will cause you to come back to a higher-tier company like us.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.

Let’s talk about how using a niched agency will get you more leads. – we are usually the best fit for growth-mode contractors over 2M+ because of the significant investment required.
That first month we create a content calendar you can take on your own and use if you wanted. We create SEO audits and will occasionally share them with you.
  * Different than many agencies – who outline the work, and tell you to do it. We do that work that’s outlined in technical audits.
  * We set out a specific word count per month and have writers in our office that write that.
  * We do outreach and get links back to your site monthly.
  * A dashboard that shows our progress, year over year traffic.








##### What makes you different from other Window and Doors marketing companies?
There are things that we do those other agencies just don’t do or don’t do as well. We get high authority backlinks (because those are the ones that work best) that help boost your Google rankings. We also do monthly reporting on how things are going and provide you with a live marketing dashboard so you can see your year-over-year increase in traffic to your site, leads, and contacts that you receive about your business.
##### How long does it take to get results from SEO?
It will take anywhere from 1 month to 3 months to start seeing some shift, and likely 6-8 months to start seeing significant ROI from work. 
That being said, if you don’t start seeing some shift in traffic (either month over month or year over year for seasonal businesses) then in most cases you should be very forward with your provider and seek a clear explanation.
is not hard. It does, however take time – it involves technical tweaks on your website, competitive analysis/content strategy, and building links from around the web.
So most people don’t have the time to get up to speed on all of the shifting trends, the technical aspects, and make sure their website is running perfectly for like a finely tuned machine.
**If you have an agency or team doing SEO + something else**
When I say 1 to 3 months for some initial returns, or 6-8 months for significant ROI – I mean that much time concerted effort, not SEO effort watered down with a redesign or an SEO + PPC agency trying to do both. Not that they can’t do that, but the time/effort/money spent would have to be double.
So my suggestion is to have a team totally dedicated to your SEO efforts, and if you want done make sure that budget is entirely separate from your Search Engine Optimization work.
Quality, well-written content is extremely beneficial for your search engine optimization — especially when that content features keywords that your customers are searching for. When certain blogs or pages are ranking high for a keyword, they will get clicked on more — and Google notices that.
To simply put it, Google rewards websites that have content that void of grammatical errors, are dense with keywords (but not overly saturated), and are high in quality.

##### What other important things do I need to know about SEO?
Here are several vital points to remember when optimizing your website for SEO:
  * Make sure your business name, address, and phone number is consistent across all local directory listings
  * Prepare compelling videos that explain your window and door services and benefits so that people will spend more time on your page, which helps your rank higher
  * There should be at least 700 words on each of your primary product or service pages
  * For pages on your site that drive in revenue, create titles and headings that match the keywords that people are searching
