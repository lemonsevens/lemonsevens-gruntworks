Generate qualified leads and close deals that result in ideal clients.
You want to win more business. You want to be a leader in your local market and be admired by your peers.
You grind every day to build a respected business you can be proud of. To create the lifestyle you want for yourself and your family. To provide for your employees and community.


Our clients spend between $70,000 and $100,000 over the course of a year with Landscape Leadership®. One-off project work starts at $25,000. We do not work with franchises, retailers, consultants, software companies, or e-commerce companies. Start-up companies are seldom a good fit.
# Learn How Landscape Leadership® Can Help You Win More Business
(Just as we've done for Kingstowne Lawn & Landscape in Alexandria, VA, whose website has generated over 5,000 new leads in the last 3 years)
Our pricing is different for each client dependent on the unique scope of services provided throughout the course of a year. We do not shoehorn our clients into generic tiered pricing packages as is common with many marketing services providers.
We reserve capacity for 20 to 25 companies at any one time. These companies have Landscape Leadership® on a monthly retainer in which we provide ongoing services for a set amount each month. Our clients spend between $70,000 and $100,000+ over the course of a year. The scope of services within each retainer agreement is unique.
The cost of working with Landscape Leadership® in this way can be significantly less than hiring an experienced marketing and/or business development person in-house.
Our remaining capacity is reserved for “special projects”, most commonly website design/ development projects, extensive video and photography projects, and sales and marketing-related consulting programs.
Hiring an outside firm can actually cost a company less than hiring in-house, especially over two to three years. The reality is that you will need to pay top dollar for elite in-house marketing talent. An intern won't cut it today. Chances are the salary and additional onboarding costs you will need to pay will be higher than the annual amount you pay an outside firm.
When you hire a sales and marketing agency like Landscape Leadership® you're hiring an entire expert team of professionals, not a single individual.
Good luck finding a single individual with the experience and specialized knowledge needed to implement a fully integrated program that includes content marketing, social media, SEO, advertising, email marketing, and web design/development. A marketing team like Landscape Leadership® will have all of these capabilities (along with the necessary strategic and creative chops)
It's hard to find in-house help with the sales and marketing expertise you need plus experience in the lawn and landscape industry. You need both — and that's exactly what Landscape Leadership® brings to the table.
One person cannot possibly do everything required to execute a sophisticated strategy in today's new age of marketing.
It's hard enough to find an in-house marketing superstar, but keeping them happy and on your team for the long haul is even more difficult. The reality is that your top talent is going to move on to bigger and better opportunities, leaving your lawn and landscape company in the endless cycle of recruiting and training.
Hiring, training, payroll, benefits, taxes… The list goes on. It's a pain having employees! Hiring an outside marketing agency is a much simpler, less painful process.
> We get more leads in historically slower months than we used to get in the peak of spring and it's just continuing to grow! In marketing, when you can get stretched so thin, Landscape Leadership has been an awesome resource to keep us moving in a positive direction.

Get more profitable tree work projects and plant health care customers.

Our team can provide strategic insight and creative direction for direct mail, print ads, and more.
We'll create and distribute quality written, photo, and video content to educate and engage your social followers.
(Just as we've done for Joshua Tree Experts, whose website has generated over 11,000 new leads in the last 8 years)
Since 2008, Landscape Leadership has successfully collaborated with numerous tree service companies across various regions of the U.S., including the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and Western states.

Even within the closely-related green industry, there are differences such as:
  * Pest control digital ads are very expensive due to so many large competitors with deep pockets.
  * Pest control is a service most consumers don't want, they typically buy them when they have existing problems. 
  * Pest control websites need to be lead conversion machines. Consumers want their answers fast and you to respond even more quickly.


These are just some ways pest control company marketing is different from promoting , , , , and .

You want to connect with ideal clients. You know that landing the right residential landscaping and irrigation accounts will result in profitable recurring revenue.

Marketing landscape design and installation requires different approaches than those used to promote other industries.
Even within the green industry, there are differences such as:
  * Homeowners are emotionally driven and spend a lot of time researching options and solutions for large projects.
  * The landscape design sales process can be long and requires nurturing prospects so they don't lose interest.
  * Websites need to pre-qualify leads to filter out bad-fit leads that don't understand pricing or fit your landscaping company's positioning.

I’ve always had an interest in learning new things, analyzing problems, and coming up with solutions. After graduating from Stetson University I had plans to work in marketing research, but through the years my career took a path towards digital marketing. Working in digital marketing I get to utilize my research and analytical skills, while always learning new things in the ever-changing digital world.
After working at a couple of marketing agencies I entered the green industry as the Web Marketing Specialist for a lawn care company. I never would have imagined how much I’d enjoy working in the industry. My lawn wasn’t something I focused on much, but that changed just a few weeks into the new position. I began noticing things in my lawn that I wanted to improve. I even started looking more at my neighbors’ lawns. 
New things I learn at work have always had at least a small impact on my personal life, but nothing like lawn care. At Landscape Leadership I get to continue providing marketing services in an industry I truly care about, and that is something I’m very thankful for.

# Customer Referral Programs: Tips & Examples for Landscaping, Lawn Care and Tree Service Companies
There’s no sense arguing the point: Customer referrals are one of the best sources to grow your lawn care, landscaping or tree service company. 
Industry peers concur that than most other marketing mediums and **the customers that result also are more easy to retain**.
I’ve been in the green industry for about 20 years now and have personally had the opportunity to take a referral program delivering mediocre results and see it become a business development powerhouse for a sales team.
I’ve also seen my share of what companies offer up for their customer referral programs and had a little glimpse into what they do to promote them.
, asking for feedback and also later reached out to other companies to see what they are offering. I wanted to know a few things:
In my experience over the past couple decades, I’ve seen that **less than half of green industry companies have a formal program**. While they are more common among , landscape companies and tree services don’t always have a program defined. Many state that they indeed offer rewards for referrals, but it ends up being more a token of appreciation after the fact. 
In a lot of cases in which I inquired, respondents knew they had a program, but were unsure of the details (even company owners).
About two-thirds of the companies with a program had some sort of reward defined, specifically if they were a B2C company. and seemed to handle this on a case-by-case basis.
**Here are some of the referral rewards that green industry pros are currently offering:**
  * Gift card to key accounts once a year, and ask at that time for referrals (commercial maintenance company)


  * $50 credit on their account if their referral becomes a new client (residential lawn care company)


  * $75 credit for sold referrals and also give discounts if next door neighbors sign up for services (residential lawn and landscape maintenance company)


  * $25 credit to a customer for a sold referral or a $25 VISA gift card if they aren’t an active customer (residential lawn care company)


  * $50 check, enclosed in a handwritten thank you card for sold referrals (residential full-service lawn/tree/landscape company)


  * $25 credit to the referring customer and $25 coupon to the new customer (residential lawn and tree care company)


  * Customer credit of $35 for smaller residential landscape maintenance projects or unstated, discretionary credits for larger design/build projects (residential design and maintenance company)


  * Tiered rewards for residential design/build referrals that end in a $25,000 or higher job (VISA gift card of $200 for first referral, $500 for second, $1,500 for third referral in a year-or instead of the VISA, they can choose a $1,500 weekend get-away)


### 3. How has your customer referral program been working for your lawn care, tree service or landscaping company?
Most of the companies I talked to also they got, how much revenue it resulted in, nor what their closing rates were.
Now while I recognize that this information isn’t readily accessible or on the tip of the tongue of everyone in the company, I find that this is pretty common. Only about 10% of the companies I surveyed could cite customer referrals as one of their top three marketing sources. Those companies did also concur with my prior experience of .
However, ask yourself or industry peers these questions and they will .
**(RELATED READING:[5 Practical & Effective Cross-Selling Strategies to Earn More Revenue from Your Customers](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/5-practical-effective-cross-selling-strategies-earn-more-revenue-from-current-customer-base))**
If your company has a great customer referral program, your team and your customers will know about it. You and most of your team will know just how effective it is, and it will grow year over year.
But it doesn’t happen on its own. It takes three things to succeed:
Discounts, credits, gifts and cash are waved in front of consumers every day, trying to entice them to be brand evangelists. As more and more companies formalize customer referral programs, (remember mail-in rebates?).
Are you just offering chump change? Customer referral programs are just one opportunity to be different than your competitors. If so, would it excite your spouse or friend? Ask them to give you a candid reaction. You may think it’s generous, but it could be extremely mediocre.
Personally, I think $50 cash is a tipping point for a referral that leads to $400-$1,000 in business for your company. Credits may be good for some people, but they mean they have to spend more money with you. Cash is king in my mind. But then, that’s what motivates me. And the company that offers up to $1,500 for the third design/build referral in a year? Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about!
However, **not every customer is going to be motivated by a monetary reward**. A $50 gift card to the hippest new restaurant in your community could just be a cool way of saying thank you.
**Another idea is, instead of giving cash, make a donation** to your customer's favorite charity. If a they send you a $15,000 design/build customer there's no reason not to give at least $100 to that client's favorite charity. That personalizes the thank you more.
And speaking of personal touches, take a few minutes and . Enough with credit line items on statements or an impersonal email! If you’re super busy and have 300 referrals to pay out a year, go ahead and get your receptionist to write it, but make sure it’s signed by the company owner.
Tastefully . The reason your team doesn’t know what it is and why your customers haven’t a clue is because you aren’t telling them enough.
Quiz your team frequently about the program’s details. Whether they are in sales, the office or out in the field, they should all know it well.
_**(Above is a great example of how our client, , generates customer referrals right on their website.)**_
**There are many places and mediums in which you can communicate the program with your customers such as:**
  * On your website (have a subtle link in the main navigation and on its own page, possibly in a sidebar here and there, and in the footer menu)


Wherever, whatever and whenever, and make it . Be the company that says, “WE LOVE REFERRALS!”
Nothing will suck the wind out of your brand evangelists’ sails more quickly, than crappy follow-up and lousy tracking. Again, referrals close higher than any other marketing mediums and the resulting customers are the least likely to cancel. This should be a HUGE priority for your company.
Follow up on referrals , and try to contact them no less than three times. and store them in the customer’s file in the CRM you’re using and track it along the way.
Connect it as well to the new prospect. When the new prospect sells, pay your customer their reward quickly. Don’t let them get a chance to wonder where their reward ever got to! If they call in a month after their friend’s project is completed and you haven’t paid them, it raises suspicion of if you forgot.
Even if the referral doesn’t sell, . Thank them for trusting you enough to spread your name, ask them to continue to refer business to you, and let them know the outcome of their referral.
Be sure to also have that prospect’s account flagged in case they change their mind later. It sure will tick off your customer if they end up seeing your trucks at their referred neighbor’s house 6 months later!
Make sure your team is regularly updated on the success of your referral program. Create some excitement about its results and they will remember to promote it more often.
**(RELATED READING:[How to Set Up a Sales Tracking System for your Landscaping Company](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-sales-tracking-process-for-your-landscaping-company))**
## More and More Lawn Care, Landscaping & Tree Service Customers
**Profitable, easy-closing sales of loyal customers is what it’s all about!** If you want your customer referral program to work, it can’t be an afterthought. Get together with your team and brainstorm about how you can create a truly unique (and very generous) offer.
Think about how much money it takes in marketing dollars to acquire a new customer. Many industry experts say it costs anywhere from $100-$150 on average to acquire a new customer. Why would you offer a customer significantly less than that for a qualified referral?
to refer and keep track of the results and celebrate successes often and in no time you’ll be surprised at just how many referrals your customers are bringing in.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/from-green-to-screen-mastering-landscaping-video-production

I recently had the fantastic opportunity to be a guest on "The Commercial Landscaper Podcast". Join me and host, of , as we explore the world of video production for commercial landscaping companies. Robert says their podcast specializes in "pure dead brilliant" ideas to help grow your landscaping business and that's what I aimed to bring in this episode. We cover topics such as:
  * Brief overview of my 25-year experience in the green industry
  * How video can solve a myriad of problems for commercial landscapers
  * The big reasons video efforts commonly fail in the green industry
  * Some of the best commercial landscaping videos Landscape Leadership® has created
  * How to leverage your video investments over the coming years


The video podcast version is below. Or if you'd rather listen, check out the .
In today’s highly competitive marketplace, having an edge in is essential. One of the most powerful tools to help landscaping companies stand out is video. 
However, creating effective video content requires more than just capturing a few drone shots and uploading them to your . To truly leverage the power of video, you need a strategy that addresses your unique business challenges.With 25 years of experience in the green industry and hundreds of under my belt, I've seen firsthand how impactful video can be for commercial landscaping companies. 
Here's how you can harness the power of video to grow your business, attract talent, and enhance your brand.
Many landscaping companies jump into video because they see competitors doing it. While that’s understandable, it’s important to step back and ask, "What problems are we solving?" 
Video production can be costly, and without a clear purpose, it can feel like a waste of resources. Start by identifying your biggest challenges.
Before pressing record, start with a strategy. Determine the purpose of each video. Whether it’s a recruitment piece, a client testimonial, or a case study, you need to clarify your goal upfront. 
For example, if you're showcasing your snow removal services, that’s your focus. Resist the temptation to mix in unrelated services or company history.
Check Out the Snow Contracts Video We Created for 
Your company will need dozens of videos, so keep each one focused. Start with three videos this year, and build a larger library over time.Once the purpose is clear, the next step is developing a detailed plan. 
Storyboarding, scripting, and outlining shots are essential. You should know exactly what you want from each scene, who needs to be involved, and what the location should look like. This eliminates confusion and ensures your video shoot runs smoothly.
Video production can seem complex, but you can simplify the process in some areas without sacrificing quality. 
One approach is to create text-based videos with captions that highlight key points. This eliminates the need for voiceovers, which can sometimes cause timing issues or add extra costs.
Check Out This Caption-Style, Commercial Landscape Construction Video We Created for 
Alternatively, you can use interview-based videos where team members or clients share their stories. This not only makes the production more authentic but also builds trust with prospective clients or recruits. 
However, it’s important not to oversimplify the process. Video is more than just showing up with a camera. The location needs to look pristine, and you need contingency plans in case something goes wrong.
There are various styles of videos that can work for commercial landscaping companies. Here are a few to consider:
One of the most powerful ways to show your capabilities is through client case studies. These allow potential clients to see properties similar to theirs and hear directly from property managers about the results you’ve delivered.
Check Out This Client Testimonial Video We Created for 
With labor shortages plaguing the green industry, recruitment videos are key.
Use these to highlight your company culture and show potential employees the day-to-day experience of working for your company.
Video can also be used to explain how your company tackles specific services, such as snow removal or landscape maintenance. These videos are helpful for educating both clients and new recruits.
Once you’ve nailed down the strategy and style, the next step is execution. Planning the logistics of a shoot requires meticulous attention to detail. You'll need to decide on site selection, get approvals, and organize the day down to the minute.For example, if you're filming on multiple properties, you'll want to create a schedule that allows time for travel between locations. Pay attention to factors like weather conditions, ensuring the landscaping looks fresh and the equipment is clean. Even small details, like mowing schedules, can make or break a shot.
Check Out This Video We Created for , Featuring Numerous Job Sites
One of the biggest concerns for commercial landscapers when it comes to video is cost. Yes, video production can be expensive, but it's important to view these videos as long-term assets. 
A well-produced video can be used for multiple years, across various platforms, and in different formats.For example, if you create a video explaining your commercial landscape lighting services, it can be used on your website, in email campaigns, and as part of a social media push year after year.
Check Out This Commercial Landscape Lighting Video We Created for 
Additionally, if you’re working with the same videographer over time, you can reuse old footage to save on costs for new videos.
Once your video is produced, you need to use it strategically across multiple channels. Here are a few places where your videos will make an impact:
Service pages, case study pages, and your homepage are prime locations for videos that explain your services or showcase client success stories. You can also create a video gallery, showcasing all of the videos you've created over the years. 
Here's a Sampling of the . 30+ Videos and Adding More Each Year!
Embedding videos in your emails can significantly boost engagement. Use them in recruitment campaigns or client updates.
LinkedIn is a great platform for sharing video content, especially for commercial landscapers who are looking to connect with property managers and industry professionals. Encourage your team members to share videos on their profiles for greater reach.
Videos can also help at various stages of the sales process. For example, after a new client signs a contract, a video explaining the next steps in the transition process can build confidence and set expectations.
Here's a Day in the Life of an Account Manager Video We Created for 
Video isn’t just a marketing tool—it’s a way to tell your company’s story, engage clients, and build your brand. Whether you're looking to recruit talent or secure new contracts, a strategic approach to video production can help you stand out in the competitive commercial landscaping market.
Remember, it’s not about creating just one video. It’s about building a video library that serves as a long-term asset for your company. With the right strategy, planning, and execution, video can transform your marketing efforts and drive significant results for years to come.

# 3 Green Industry Thought Leadership Tips to Beat AI Content Fluff
I have a corrugated metal tree on my office wall. When someone compliments it, I sheepishly say, “Thank you”. 
You can see the same metal tree in my friend’s man cave. We didn’t commission the same artist. 
It’s a $30 Hobby Lobby special. You could likely find this commodity artwork in thousands of other homes. There’s really nothing special about it. 
However, if you pan to the right, you’ll see an original piece by a local artist. The 3-D aerial scene depicts a vibrant forest with textures and colors of various trees, rocks, and rushing water.
Carefully selected blends of preserved moss, stone, and acrylic paint create this woodland escape.
I use the term “artist” loosely. It’s my creation. I’ve always admired moss art. So last year, I gathered various materials, including small stones from neighborhood storm drains.
Yup, I became the insane neighbor picking up gravel and stuffing it into a ziplock bag. 
It’s not an epic tale and I’m no famous artist. But 
Like commodity art, AI content marketing is easily produced. However, it’s often undifferentiated and often forgotten. 
AI is a fabulous time-saver that is commonly misused. The internet now has warehouses full of cheap, manufactured thoughtless content. If your lawn care or landscaping company is going to stand out as a thought leader, you’re going to have to do something different. 
[RELATED PODCAST: [Thoughtful vs. Thoughtless Content; and, How to Leverage Content Internally](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/thoughtful-vs-thoughtless-content-marketing-how-to-leverage-internally)]
One of the great SEO and content marketing minds I follow is Andy Crestodina from Orbit Media. Earlier this year, he published a thoughtful article you should check out, [_AI for Thought Leadership: 5 Prompts to Get You Halfway There_](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/ai-thought-leadership/). 
Andy argues that while AI excels at generating commodity content, it lacks the personal experience and strong viewpoints essential for true thought leadership.
He suggests that AI can assist in some aspects of content creation but emphasizes that authentic thought leadership content must be crafted by humans to effectively connect with audiences.
In order to beat AI at this game, there are three things Andy and I believe you should do: 


Let’s unpack practical ways that green industry companies can become thought leaders.
Whether it’s blog articles, website pages, or social posts, . AI will regurgitate facts and summarize. It will not have a firm opinion and will try to cover all the bases. 
But be honest. You have opinions. They can lead to differentiated marketing. They can be compelling in the sales process. They can give peace of mind to your customers. 
I lost count of how many times I stood in a backyard and had a prospect or customer tell me, “Well, I’ll trust you…you’re the expert.” I'm sure you can relate.
So where are your expert opinions? Why are they missing on website pages, blog articles, and social posts? 
AI has no practical experience. It has no strong beliefs. It’s never pushed a spreader, created hundreds of landscape plans, or dropped a 60’ oak between a house and a detached garage.
  * “It was a hot dry October in the northeast. We never saw this before…” (unique introduction)
  * “Landscapers who plant crabapples in parking lots should be ashamed…” (take a stand)
  * Article Title: Why We Love Rectangular Fire Pits & You Should, Too (share emotion)


AI is helpful but it’s a social outcast. It has no friends. One of the ways your green industry company can become a thought leader is to leverage your relationships with real people. 
In written web and social content, this can manifest in many ways. Here are a few:
  * Case studies with both your opinions/emotions and your client’s perspective
  * Guest posts or your expert insights in association websites’ content marketing


Leveraging video, even within written content, is a kill shot for AI content. 
We should not be corporate, faceless brands full of replaceable, easily-exchangeable content. Video is a power-move to stand out in a crowd of sameness.
  * 72% of consumers have said that they would prefer to learn about services in a video format.
  * 54% of email subscribers prefer emails that contain video content.
  * 91% of users want to see more video marketing content from businesses.
  * 45% of users want to see more live video content on social media platforms.


Lawn care and landscaping companies are dipping their toes into the video pool. The brands that jump in head first are more likely to win. 
There are so many applications for videos, and your brand is likely missing the bulk of them. Here are a few ways to leverage video in your quest for thought leadership:
Create unique pages for each role you commonly hire for.
Imagine a video showing what it's like to work on a maintenance crew on the Crew Member and Crew Leader job posting pages. 
Instead of only creating image portfolios, create robust pages featuring images, written perspectives, and client testimonials featured in a compelling video story.
This is one of my favorite case study videos we've created. No one says it better than a happy client. 
It’s still critical to answer frequently asked questions with written content. However, videos allow you a unique opportunity to leverage your expertise and brand personality. 
I asked Paul from Lawn & Pest Solutions if I could write some silly scripts using a bunch of southern colloquialisms. He was totally game and it makes a boring topic stand out! Give it a watch. 
Whether on a video library page, Google Ads landing page, social media content, or embedded within blog articles or emails, your team’s friendly faces can turn your impersonal brand into trusted advisors with practical advice.

# 1 Fatal Flaw of Landscaping & Lawn Care Marketing Videos (& How to Fix It)
There's one common, fundamental failure when marketing in the lawn and landscape industry. Brands don't know their role in the customer story. 
Your company is not at the center of your customer's universe. The customer is.
Your customer is the frustrated homeowner that keeps failing with DIY methods. They're the property manager that keeps hiring the wrong service providers. And, don't forget another important customer of your lawn or landscape company. They're the job seeker that wonders if they will just keep moving from one dead-end job to another.
But what do landscaping and lawn care companies frequently do?
  * They talk about services and products they have to offer


Yuck...companies that get this wrong are subconsciously abrasive. They confuse their buyers. They get fewer leads and sell less.
Your brand's goal is to subtly and humbly help your customer create a better story for themselves. Don't make yourself out to be the "big deal".
We've created hundreds of marketing videos here at Landscape Leadership. And, I believe we've learned how to position our clients' customers at the center of most of these videos. The result is a refreshing marketing alternative to what most green industry companies are producing. 
There is a better way to create marketing videos for your lawn care or landscaping company. 
A few years ago, Rob Reindl (owner) and Adam Zellner (VP of sales) at recommended a book, . The simple, yet powerful framework of telling customer stories has impacted almost every area of my marketing messaging approach. One of the facets of this framework is positioning the customer as the central fixture and telling their story over a brand's.
So when Oasis was ready to create five new video productions, you can bet we spent a lot of time talking about prospective customers and how their brand could help them to subtly and humbly them to get what they want. Rob and his team had some powerful things to communicate, and I couldn't be more pleased with how these videos turned out. 
As you watch the stories in the following four videos, put yourself in the shoes of these frustrated customers. Pay attention to the emotion inside of you. Listen to the specific phrases we used in these scripts. Notice how much the videos feature the customer over Oasis.
Job seekers are just another type of customer you will market to. Position your employer brand as the guide that helps the frustrated job seeker find a career they love. Check out how we did this in this recruiting video.
We created four marketing videos plus the recruiting video. These videos have been used as:


_"When making our service videos, we decided that we really wanted to put the focus on the customer and their experience at their property. Landscape Leadership helped develop a plan that portrayed what their life could be versus of a video detailing what our company does and who we are. We're so proud of how these videos turned out!" - Adam Zellner, VP of Sales_
Again, buy the book, . Even if your paradigm is transformed by the book, it can take practice to develop the skills to script and produce videos for your lawn or landscape company. It can be a lot to manage, so you may want to hire a video production company or marketing agency that understands the StoryBrand framework. 
If you’d like to learn more about video marketing for your , , , or , we have other And if you’d like to see more examples of putting customers at the center of your marketing messaging, check out

When I hit the road to return to my hometown Pittsburgh from San Diego almost ten years ago, I left with a short-term gig at my buddy’s new landscaping company awaiting me. Since then, the short-term has turned into a career.
My time in the green industry has taken me from the field to the road to the office, where I’ve had my hands in everything from technician labor on a small design-build team to account management of a large book of commercial maintenance clients.
Landscaping seemed like a departure from my background in writing and marketing, but I found there was a great opportunity to create new marketing initiatives hidden somewhere under the deluge of production and sales. 
My landscape marketing work gradually moved from ‘extra-credit’ projects in the winter months to more formal and impactful efforts aimed at helping small businesses break out of the green industry pile. Joining the team at Landscape Leadership has given me a chance to help uncover these opportunities for landscape businesses all over the country.
Sharing a home office with a giant dog and wild toddler. On occasion, escaping to the peace and quiet of my band’s rehearsal space.
I’ve found there’s still plenty of room for small and family businesses to operate comfortably without being muscled out by very corporate companies. The best small business owners put the same love into their companies that their clients put into their homes. Helping to guide homeowners and business owners through projects that mean so much to them is always rewarding.

From my first business class in college, I instantly knew that I wanted to pursue a career in Marketing. I love understanding why people make the decisions that they do in order to better serve the customer and improve results for the business.
Since graduating from Aurora University, I have worked for a wide range of companies from education to lawn care and many things in between. I have spent a lot of time focused in the digital marketing space and have really enjoyed this ever-changing area, which has allowed me to continue learning new things.
Working in the Green Industry space has been one of my favorite areas. I am constantly being challenged and have been able to test and try new methods to reach the best results possible for clients.
This has also been true in my personal life as I keep learning new tricks of the trade to keep up with my own yard. It has come a long way, but still a work in progress. I love that Landscape Leadership allows me to continue working with businesses in the Green Industry and helping them to grow their business.
In my home office in the winter and then as soon as we warm up enough I am outside on my patio with a Diet Coke.
I love the impact it has on a community. The green industry creates a sense of pride for towns across the country and makes everyone feel better about where they live. I love partnering with companies that are working to make the communities around them a more beautiful place to be.

I was born and raised in Lancaster, PA, where we are lucky enough to see all four seasons. I went on to attend college at West Virginia University and then on to Temple University in Philadelphia. All this to say, I’ve seen a little bit of everything. I started my education as a business major but switched to communications after a few months (a good call on my part). Marketing is my passion and what I’m happy doing most. 
I’ve held roles in both account and project management at a large digital marketing agency that supported many national and local brands. I also served as a marketing director at a prestigious, accounting firm which helped me gain more perspective on the challenges of building brand recognition in a local market. 
My agency and local marketing roles ultimately led me to Landscape Leadership. In fact, it was one of their photographers that recommended I check them out. While I don’t have a ton of background in the green industry, I’m more than ready to dig in. Managing websites and various projects, keeping people and tasks on track, and seeing the success it brings to our clients is why I do what I do.
At home, listening to something different every day, trying not to eat the entire fridge. When it's nice out, front porch with a seltzer water.
I love how beautiful outdoor spaces can transform your mood. Getting outside and being surrounded by lush greens, blooming trees, and the fresh air is inspiring and calming at the same time. I also love how the green industry will never go out of style but is filled with innovation.

After graduating from CU Boulder, I had aspirations to become a Landscape Architect - helping design and bring to life the green fabric weaved throughout American cities. I also had to pay rent and becoming a Landscape Architect was a long way off. So I did what any starving college graduate would do and got a job doing physical labor in the middle of the Colorado summer.
What started as a job to pay the bills turned into a 9-year journey through the landscaping industry. Before I knew it, I was managing an installation crew before the first winter came. I was out shoveling snow drifts at night and producing spreadsheets by day. Over the years I continued to broaden my experiences across all divisions of the company until I was managing a huge umbrella of operations - crew production, fleet, facilities, snow services, IT, marketing, the list goes on (literally, it’s really long).
As time went on, I found myself drawn more towards focusing on the marketing efforts of the company - updating the graphic style for a modern age, streamlining and clarifying the messaging, and spearheading new efforts to produce more leads for the business. After leaving the prospect of being a Landscape Architect behind, I finally found a new passion in the green industry.
It wasn’t until I worked with Landscape Leadership® that I found that I could make a career focused on this passion. As a member of the team, I get to leverage my knowledge of landscape operations and passion for marketing to help green industry companies across the country find, grow, and evolve their client base.
In my basement office surrounded by all the kitsch I’ve collected over the years along with my wife, daughter, and dog.
The ability to create and maintain beautiful spaces that bring people closer to their families, friends, communities, and nature itself. Whether it’s building an outdoor extension to a home’s gathering space, maintaining a healthy green lawn, or even clearing snow and ice from a business, green industry companies don’t just focus on revenue streams - they play a critical and essential role in communities around the country.

# 13 Website Elements (with Examples) That Disqualify Bad Landscaping & Lawn Care Leads
“They had no clue how much a patio/lawn program costs.”
Sound familiar? Do you ever get the feeling that your lawn care or landscaping prospects are clueless tire-kickers that just eat up all of your precious time?
**Maybe the problem isn’t your prospect. Maybe your website does a lousy job of disqualifying bad-fit leads.**
Wasted time means less time you can spend closing better opportunities (which ultimately leads to less profit for your company).
And if your website isn’t disqualifying bad-fits, it is likely that it’s also not generating the great leads you’re really after.
Today, I’m going to show you some practical ways (and examples) of how lawn care and landscaping websites can do that.
Previously, we wrote an article about a . I encourage you to check it out. 
The BANT+P framework looks at five criteria to assess a good fit:
**I am not talking about what happens during the sales process.** You’re going to do some of this on the phone, over email, or when you meet with the prospect. 
Please also understand that there is an overlap with these suggestions. Some of these website elements can address multiple facets of BANT+P. 
We’re going to look at **how your website can do this before your time is wasted in the sales process.**
If you don’t disqualify bad-fit lawn care or landscaping leads in this area, you’ll end up with:
  * Price shoppers (who often cancel when they find a cheaper price)


No fun and a waste of your time. Here are some ways your website can disqualify these types of bad-fit leads.
After spending 20+ years in the green industry, I understand that there are a lot of variables that go into pricing lawn care and landscaping services. However, interested prospects just need to know a basic idea of pricing at this point. 
Whether it’s talking about lawn care programs, building a patio, or even commercial maintenance, price/cost blog articles are a great way to steer away bad-fit prospects. These articles address cost-impacting factors involved and give ballpark ranges, when possible. 
Here’s an example of how addressed this for one solution they provide:
Okay, say someone isn’t patient enough to read an article about what a patio with an outdoor kitchen costs. Additionally, you can create an interactive pricing calculator on your website. 
Check out how does this to give residential design/build prospects a starting point for research (and disqualify bad-fits).
You can even build out an e-commerce solution to measure lawns, price programs, and purchase services. This can work for a variety of service offerings in the green industry.
In some instances, it’s a lot easier to give prospects an idea of pricing. For instance, the lawn care pricing shows a starting point, and what’s included in the costs. This also steers away small, less profitable work prospects may want to purchase as a one-off service. 


[RELATED READING: [Why & How to Address Cost of Services on Your Website](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/why-how-to-address-cost-of-services-on-website-lawn-care-landscaping)]
Program and pricing pages are a great way to visually explain what is included in your services, but creating a video is another way to build value and trust as your prospect considers their options. Check out this Pest Control Programs & Pricing video uses just above where those pricing options are laid out side-by-side on their website. 
You could even create videos comparing your professional services to other popular DIY methods (or your competitor’s solution). 
The images you use on your website can disqualify or deter certain projects. For example, say you primarily want to design and install residential design/build projects that are over $75,000. If your images show larger-scale projects with a patio, pavilion, and outdoor fireplace, it will give an initial impression as you see here on the homepage. 
Maybe you don’t really want to just install a fire pit. You want that fire pit to be part of a project that has a larger patio, lighting, and pergola. Using these kinds of specific images subconsciously conveys you build entire spaces vs. just a single feature. 
It’s not to say that you won’t accept smaller projects, but this can help to deter some of them if you so desire. 
This same strategy can be used if you have the appetite for specific clientele. If your company is shifting to only service large commercial properties, your images should convey that positioning.

Maybe you have plenty of leads and you’re interested in raising your average customer value. One way to do this is to clearly state your minimum level of engagement (MLOE) on your consultation page or other places on your website. Here’s an example:
[RELATED READING: [When & How to Raise Prices for Landscaping & Lawn Care Services](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/when-how-raise-prices-landscaping-lawn-care-services)]
  * B2C: Adult heads of household (both of them in many cases)


Getting to the “table” with the right people all starts in the marketing process. 
Here are some ways that your website can qualify the authority of your prospects.
If you want to attract prospects with decision-making authority, offering up tips that would be of exclusive interest to the right parties is a good move. For example, say you want to target HOA board members. They often deal with confused residents who make false assumptions about their own responsibility vs. those of the contracted landscape service provider. 
This article on the blog is a great way to attract HOA board members vs. community residents. Just look at how the article begins. 
When someone requests a consultation, you can add required form fields to ask a simple question that would indicate their authority. 
For example, on our website, one of the questions we ask is, “Position at company”. This helps me see if I’m going to be talking with someone who can truly make a decision or someone just fishing for information to pass on. I will treat each of those situations differently.
In the case of residential landscape design/build, you may ask a simple question like:
“Who will be involved in your decision?”, and then give options such as:


Another great way to reinforce which decision-makers need to be involved is to create testimonial videos that include customers that had authority in their decision process.
Here’s a great example of how to do this if you’re a commercial landscape company. Check out how this video on the website features an HOA president.
You can also do this for B2C services. Check out this video on the website that features both Mr. and Mrs. talking about how they made the decision together.

Need and timing go hand-in-hand. After all, if they have a need, but don’t need your services relatively soon, that’s not a very qualified prospect. You may want to keep marketing to them, but they’re not ready for the sales process. 
Tire-kickers can be infuriating. Like you have nothing better to do with your day than to answer 50 questions from someone who is just going to end up doing the work themselves or won’t be ready for a proposal for months (or years) from now. 
There are a couple of ways you can do this. The most simple option would be to offer checkboxes for the services of interest to them. You can see here how does this with a required field. 
The addition of another field for “Comments” can ask open-ended questions. However, if you want to understand your prospect’s timeline, you can ask more direct questions such as, “When are you hoping to install your new irrigation system?”
On your website’s homepage and/or consultation/quote request pages, it’s good to show prospects how making a good decision takes time. This can sort out people who are in a rush or want to buck your process.
As you can see on the website’s homepage and consultation request page, the methodical (but simple) process is clearly explained. 
If a simple process module doesn’t offer up enough information, you can create content marketing that explains more processes. 
Here’s an example of how addresses that it takes time to fix problems with your lawn’s soil. This can help to deter prospects that are in a big rush and don’t want to wait for real results.
Big projects like building a pool and the surrounding landscape take time. addresses this and many other lead qualification factors in their in-depth Complete Swimming Pool Planning Guide.
Videos are a great way to show what comes next. One of the issues we were having on our website was with bad-fit leads that were in a rush (in addition to other red flags). 
I created a short video that I added to our “Schedule a Meeting” page. This is something you could do to disqualify bad-fit leads for your lawn or landscape company. 
You could also detail the design/build process or explain how long it takes to transform a lawn. There are a lot of opportunities for videos to deter bad-fit prospects.
I’m always impressed by companies that require design or consultation fees. The design fee is becoming more widely-recognized by prospects. However, a consultation fee is a step beyond this. 
Requiring pre-qualified prospects to put some “skin in the game” can really help to keep prospects from wasting your team’s time. 
has done such an amazing job over the years by leveraging this. Oh, and it doesn’t hurt their chances. This page gets 35% of all visitors to fill out the form, knowing they have to pay for a consultation (time to raise that consultation price!).

As you’ve read through the examples above, you’ll see how addressing BANT with certain elements on your website can help prospects to understand pieces of your company’s positioning. 
  * Who you do it for (residential homeowners in San Francisco)
  * How you do it (process, price minimums, full programs, etc.)


[RELATED READING: [The Fine Art of Positioning (or, how to Differentiate Yourself From All the Generalists in the Lawn & Landscape Industry](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/positioning))
Here are some additional ways to help disqualify bad-fit prospects that don’t support your company’s positioning. 
Whether it’s with the words on your website or with video, you can really dive deeper into what kind of work and what kind of people you want to work for. 
Check out how communicates their unique positioning regarding landscape maintenance customers.
You could even create a prominent page about your ideal client (Who We Serve) or segments of them. communicates this right in their navigation and also dives into the segments deeper on subsequent website pages.
It’s frustrating when you get a lead that’s not in your service area. One way to reduce this is to use customer maps and copywriting. 
You can also create separate pages that show your service area in more detail or include zoomable Google Maps embedded on your consultation page as you see here in this example we embedded on ’s quote request page. 
You can also write content that addresses several aspects of your company’s positioning (landscape lighting for homeowners in Orlando). Check out how does this on their blog.
It’s common to be shortsighted when it comes to your approach to lead qualification. As you can see, multiple website elements will make a quicker impact on your success.
It doesn’t just mean better leads. Sales will happen more easily. Your clients will be happier when they align with your company’s positioning. This all contributes to more future success for your lawn and landscape business. 
In order to make this happen, it’s going to require that you start answering some of the questions that determine what a “good lead” is for your company.

You might say I've been in the landscape industry for quite awhile...
But seriously...If you read my resume, you'll probably be scratching your head at some point. This guy goes to school for Biblical Studies, becomes a pastor, then ends up a couple decades later as a Green Industry marketing professional? Never saw that one coming.
I didn't know the destination when I started my 25+ year career in the industry. Opportunities from operations, sales, marketing, and management just presented themselves.
The truth is, every road I've been blessed to walk on so far has helped me become uniquely skilled to do what I do.
  * Take knowledge and teach it to others so they can clearly understand its practical use and be excited about it? Sure, I can do that.
  * Understand what materials work best on specific lawn weeds? Yeah, I got that one down.
  * Have a sickly lawn or tree that needs to be diagnosed? Yeah been there, done that, got the t-shirt.
  * Take someone who doesn't give a darn about their property and get them to sign a contract for tens of thousands of dollars of work? No problemo.
  * Take fossilized marketing methods of a green industry company and make it the most innovative player in their market, all while growing the business 12-15% each year, helping it to become one of the Top 150 landscaping companies in the country? I eat that for breakfast.
The best part? Now I get to do this over and over, not just for one company, but for many!


In this episode of Growing in the Green Industry, Chad shares his non-traditional career path and how he used varied experiences to create the 25-year green industry career he loves.
When the weather is nice, I'm sitting on the paver patio in my backyard, surrounded by trees, shrubs, and a killer-green lawn.
Sometimes Juno, my office assistant and pug, comes for a visit. She isn't much help...just snores loudly and eats mulch.
If the weather is ugly, I'll be in my home office amidst my house plants, and moss art wall hangings (my newest hobby), and motorcycle decor.
I love creating and preserving beauty. There's nothing more fulfilling than to see an eyesore of a property become the most gorgeous spot on the block. 
Helping companies market green industry services is truly a gift! Plus there's always something to learn. 
Even after earning credentials such as ISA Certified Arborist and Landscape Industry Certified Technician, the pursuit of knowledge continues!

Over the past couple decades I’ve been involved in the Green Industry. I’ve held roles in production, selling and marketing. I’ve seen lots of horrible, average, and downright awesome methods of . Some I’ve stumbled upon on my own, some from tree service industry experts, and a few learned from painful, personal mistakes.
It would seem like a simple definition, but there are still a lot of misconceptions about . Marketing is not the responsibility of one person at your company or even a few, but rather of your entire organization.Stop introducing Larry as your “Marketing Guy”. You’re all in marketing. It’s just Larry’s job to lead the Marketing Crew.

It follows a prospect from when they don’t even know who you are to the point where they’re telling everyone how wonderful you are.
plan and can enlist a variety of specific tools. We’ll get into those in a moment, but first it’s absolutely crucial to understand how to set your company’s marketing efforts up for success. 
I’ve done this for one of the Top 150 Landscaping Companies in the country, so this isn’t just some online marketing “ninja” (I hate that term) waving his arms around like an idiot. Stick with me.
Everyone who climbs a tree or pulls a hose to spray a property knows that giving some thought to your process  is critical. The same is true for your marketing strategy.
Who are your customers? Who are 2-3 types of your ideal customer? **Buyer Personas are the root of tree service marketing success.** They aren’t some term marketers throw around to seem like they are sophisticated, they’re critical to finding more business. 
Buyer personas are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers. Understanding who they are will be part of every decision you make when considering the latest shiny, new

Oh the mistakes I’ve made and seen. But this is not all about me, it’s about you and your tree care company. Here’s a quick list of main points to help you start to consider what you may be doing wrong:
  * on EVERY contact and be able to provide detailed reports on where your leads come from. in knowing where to spend your marketing dollars.


  * Don’t compete with big brands if you aren’t one. Not many people are singing, “I like big BRANDS, and I cannot lie.”


  * Break-up with bad marketing methods. It’s not you, it’s them. If you’re getting nothing out of the relationship, why are you in it?


  * If you can’t tell someone how much you spent last year on marketing, how many people clicked on an offer, how long it took Tony on your sales team to propose or close an opportunity, or other valuable metrics, you’re throwing a rope in a tree hoping the branch will support you, when it may not.


  * your people. Don’t make your “Marketing Guy/Gal” figure it out if it’s not their gift. If they can’t cut it, hire someone who is passionate about your company’s brand, doesn’t require constant supervision, and is hungry to learn both about trees and modern marketing trends. If a person has these qualities, it trumps experience or technical knowledge.


  * They are 2 halves of a whole. They perform separate, but yet overlapping duties for mutual, combined success. Close the loop on the buying cycle and make it easy for prospects to do business with your tree service.


  * Develop unified, clean branding. Every single element from uniforms to trucks, to pamphlets, to your website should have a uniform look. Less is more. Stick with 2-3 colors, don’t be too busy. Be bold and recognizable.


  * Have a plan for cross-selling and gaining repeat business. **Your existing and past clients are a source for an easy win.** If you are a lawn care company that also offers tree services, you better train everyone how to find opportunities and point them out to your customers. If you sell tree pruning, have a system to go back to those clients 4-6 years later for repeat business.


I**f you’ve skimmed down to this part of the article without reading the fundamentals above, have fun flushing your marketing dollars down the toilet. Go back and read them.**
However, if you’re ready, here is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Please note that these methods are part of an integrated marketing plan for tree service companies. 
I’ve compiled them in the order you should tackle them
People don’t buy like they used to. Traditional marketing focuses on interrupting people in their life and annoying the crap out of them or beating them over the head so much with marketing messages until they buy.
Consumers are fed up with traditional marketing. They’ve learned to dodge calls, skip commercials, throw away junk mail, not answer the door, and don’t even notice ads in magazines or newspapers. 
Your tree service customers aren’t even aware of problems. They have no clue that their tree is even an Ash, nor have they even heard of the Emerald Ash Borer. They haven’t looked up in their tree and seen that dead limb over their roof for at least 2 years. Heck, there’s a limb that’s been on their roof for the past 3 months.
As a tree service, when (designed and set-up), and you post regular, weekly (or more) blog articles about these topics, you answer the questions. Then when Joe from your town goes on Google and asks, “How much does it cost to trim a tree?”, BOOM, there’s your article. The search engine has been crawling all over your website and every single thing about your online brand screams,

One of the supporting ways that search engines connect people with your tree service is due to the work you or a digital agency has done with creating  offsite connections. These are things elsewhere on the internet, not on your website. They include:
  * Profiles on Google My Business, Bing Business, Yelp, Citysearch, Better Business Bureau, etc. validate what your business is about and link to your website. [**Find out the 20 Most Important Local Business Directories your Tree Services should be listed on.**](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/worksheet-local-business-directories)


  * These are clickable links on other websites that send a visitor to your website. Good inbound links may be coming from your city’s chamber of commerce, or in an online article about trees from your local newspaper. Likewise, inbound links from your member profile on the  website, will help search engines connect big authorities in the tree care industry with your brand.


  * These are the same as an inbound link, but only mention your company by name, not linking to your website. A good example would be your name mentioned in a relevant article in your local newspaper, online trade publication, or as a source for an article on Better Homes & Gardens.


  * Good , Yelp, or other offsite locations are extremely important. It helps your credibility with both search engines and prospective clients.


or at least provide enough vinyl graphics on them to be noticed. Throw away the magnets that make you look like you could go out of business tomorrow.

Vehicle graphics are a very cost-effective means to advertise. They last for 7-10 years and you only pay once for them. If you have a decent sized fleet that drives around town each day, it will be no time at all before people are telling you that they “see your trucks everywhere”.
When Joe was on your website earlier and entered his email to download your E-book, _“7 Critical Questions to Ask When Hiring a Tree Company”_ , he got an automated and personalized email from you 3 weeks later with the 3 featured blog articles from the past month, particularly one called, _“How to Tell if Your Tree has Ash Tree Borers”_

team. If a prospect tells you that they got your name from your customer who they know, pay your customer. and they will definitely keep referring you to family and friends.
How about a that sends a $50 check or VISA gift card in the mail with a handwritten thank you note from your company’s owner or the salesperson? Don’t send them a self-serving credit off their next service. Nothing says thank you like some cold cash they can spend anywhere they want.
It’s easy for tree care technicians and tree crews to get tunnel vision from production quotas. Add to that the lack of confidence with talking to your customers, and you’ll have a worker that does a great job, but isn’t part of your 
What if your tree care company incentivized your production team to talk to neighbors or point out additional service needs on properties? What if all they had to do is to create interest and make some more money on their paycheck? 
**are one of the best ways to cross-sell and get new business for your tree service.** Teach your team how to make customers and prospects aware of issues, then let your sales team sell the solution. Make it worth everyone’s while and they will start passionately working together to grow your company.
If your technicians perform 15-20 plant health care treatments each day, post a small sign at the driveway entrance. These cost pennies if you order in bulk. 
If your tree crews take down or prune trees, why not post a 18” x 24” yard sign at the road. Spending $10-$15 per sign is a drop in the bucket for the chance of adding another $1500 project down the street. 
These signs often stay in a customer’s lawn for days, if not weeks. People in the neighborhood will see them on their walks and on their commute to work.
This one is a tough one. You’ll notice that this is an important , but towards the bottom of my list. If you can dedicate internal team members to this task, it’s best. Unless you’re ready to spend some money with sponsored posts, social media will not be a huge success.
Still, strategically posting videos on YouTube, and posting pictures and blog articles to Facebook may help raise awareness of your company in your community and slightly help your search ranking. 
**takes a lot of time and a gifted, passionate team member.** It will help, but it won’t generate a ton of sales for tree services.

I really would love to leave this one off because at the ridiculously high cost of these ads, but tree service advertisements in yellow pages can work, particularly in less urban settings. If you track how people hear about you and after a year you don’t hear “Yellow Pages”, dump this one. Just follow these tips:
  * Don’t put yellow pages ahead of the list above in your allocation of 


  * Don’t go too big with ads and only increase sizes if you move significantly in the book.


  * Add color, particularly with white backgrounds to stand out on the yellow paper.


  * Don’t use yellow pages companies to do your internet advertising. They say they’re great at it, but you can get better work from a digital agency.


Tree services are tougher to market than maintaining a screaming-green lawn, or putting a paver patio in your backyard.
Your prospects are less likely to dream about pest-free Hemlocks or Pin Oaks with perfect structure. They will find you ONLINE  they’re ready. **Don’t waste your money on any of these tree service marketing ideas:**
  * Retargeting or Internet Display Ads (use this low-cost ad in moderation, but not in place of a good content marketing strategy)


  * Expensive Sponsorships of Clubs, Charities, Churches (just give them a charitable donation and stop with trying to get publicity this way)


  * Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising (in some cases it can work with services with a high level of urgency like tree removal or a particular tree pest that is very annoying)


  * Sponsored Online Lead Sites (ads on HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List, etc. are very expensive and have lower ROI than content marketing on your own website).


There you have it! The good, the bad, and some things to ponder in planning your tree service marketing plan. This stuff works! I’ve seen it firsthand, and Landscape Leadership has seen it work for other Green Industry companies that we work with.

I’ve been a copywriter, coordinator, and content strategist at multiple agencies with clients in almost every industry. I learned a lot but never got the chance to help the brands I’m most passionate about. Landscape Leadership focuses on these companies. 
From the moment I could pull the cord, I was eager to mow. I wanted to do everything I could to keep the land usable and looking nice. As I grew, so did the properties. 
I maintained a 70-acre farm for multiple years near Houston with my wife, Lene, and our two dogs, Rosa and Ruth. Maintaining this acreage was a challenging but extremely enjoyable task. The smell of diesel, the sound of a Stihl, and a cold beer, when the day is done, couldn't be beaten.
I’m here to combine this love for landscaping with nearly a decade of marketing experience to make a major impact for our clients.

# 14 Examples of Landscaping & Lawn Care Videos for Marketing or Recruiting
Videos are one of the most impactful marketing and recruiting assets in the green industry.
They can make your landscaping or appear to be on a whole other level than your competitors.
The right video can make job seekers excited about a rewarding career with your organization. 
Or, if the videos aren’t great...they can have a very effect.
Prospective customers can raise their critical eyebrows and wonder why you would ever create a video so cringe-worthy. 
In the mind of that ideal prospect or job recruit, you’ve suddenly lost all credibility. 
Maybe you are remembering some examples right now. Maybe they’re on your website….ouch…
Now cut yourself and those well-intentioned companies some slack. Creating great landscaping or lawn care videos is one of the most difficult things to pull off. Composing a unique and meaningful story, directing team members and customers, capturing pro-quality footage and sound, and editing it all together in a way it stands out...whew...that’s a lot of work!
Filming and producing landscaping or and recruiting videos has been one of my favorite things we do for our clients here at Landscape Leadership. I have some great examples for you along with some comments for more inspiration.
These lawn care and landscaping videos are typically shorter in length and have no audio. They are meant to provide captivating visuals that go a step beyond photos. Loop videos are most often used for the top of website pages and can even be used on Facebook for a cover video. 
This was a fun lawn care video to plan out for We wanted a prospect to see that they are buying quality time and relaxation. The lawn care or irrigation services are just a means to an end. We wanted this to be the first thing a prospect would see when they come to the website.
The family involved were actual customers. All it took was a few takes of this cute little guy and his furry (and very obedient) friend running back and forth. 
(RELATED READING: [12 Essential Ideas to Implement on Your Landscaping Website’s Homepage](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/12-essential-ideas-to-implement-on-your-landscaping-websites-homepage))
Another way you can repurpose video footage is to take some of your best clips and compile them together in a short video to loop on the top of a page. Here you see some clips of the team and the beautiful properties they maintain. 
We’ll have a few more examples of Level Green’s recruiting videos later in this article. 
This is probably the format you’re the most familiar with. These lawn care and landscaping videos tell a company story. These can be centrally-positioned on your website’s homepage or “About” page, or can even be reformatted as television commercials.
One of the most powerful things you can do is make your brand video more about your customers than your organization. In this video, we scripted out some empathetic statements for t owner, Scott Emerson. Then we just asked the right questions to a few customers and the result is a compelling message. 
Television commercials are not typically our first recommendation for marketing campaigns. However, if you get a few years into an effective video campaign like has, you can repurpose footage and use a professional voiceover talent to create a video like this for additional branding on TV.
It can be awkward and overwhelming to cover all the services you have to offer in a single video. There’s only so much time and you can only go so deep. 
However, if you have a place on your website where someone’s interest is obviously specific, you can create landscaping and lawn care videos that match your prospect’s context. Here are a few examples of how to do this. 
If you focus primarily on design/build but want a handful of the best maintenance accounts, it’s important to screen your customers and projects. 
I love how we used this video to not only promote but also showed what types of properties and customers is a good fit for. 
As you may imagine in the example above, interviewing multiple team members and customers adds a degree of complication to video production. However, you can also create service-specific landscaping or lawn care videos to meet the context of your website visitor in this alternative format. 
In this example, we created a specific for the corresponding page on Joshua Tree’s website. If you venture to their , you’ll see we slightly changed each video for that page’s context. 
We also created near-identical versions with added background music and a call-to-action slide at the end for them to post to social media. 
### 7. Rock Water Farm Landscapes & Hardscapes: Landscape Design Video
Maybe you have a completed project that really sells a landscape design transformation. It has an outdoor kitchen, dining and lounge areas, along with landscape lighting and an outdoor fireplace. 
This was the case for this recent project for . Watch how we used the captions, footage, and upbeat music to market not just the features, but the quality time or relaxation the customer is really after. 
Sometimes people just would rather watch a video than to read. Using a landscaping or lawn care video is ideal for visual learners. Plus, it helps communicate value for what you are offering.
For Joshua Tree, we used the various prior footage along with some captions and transitions to walk the buyer through the three program options visually right at the top of the on their website. 
This actually tripled the number of leads we get on this page! 
We also did this for their packages and are working on a version now for their new Pest Control packages as well.

Level Green Landscaping works on various types of commercial properties. One type of client they love working with are local churches. Check out how this would appeal to you if you were responsible for finding the right commercial landscaper at your church!

Case studies can also overcome undesirable perceptions. Earth, Turf, & Wood primarily designs and builds large, high-end projects. However, they love the right smaller projects as well and want prospects to realize that. Check out how this case study tells a great story about a smaller project completed for this couple with a modest home.
We also have a few more of these case study style on their website. 
One of the biggest challenges the green industry faces is finding good team members. Green industry recruiting videos can position your company as an employer of choice.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/closed-lost-reasons-turn-rejections-into-landscaping-sales-wins

Closing rates are only part of the picture. As a landscaping company, you may know how many jobs you won this year and how many proposals you sent, but more insightful data is often out of reach.
Your landscaping sales team spends a lot of time nurturing prospects through the process. Proposals often take hours (even days) to prepare. The last thing you want is a leaky pipeline with no idea how to plug its holes.
Why are deals not closing? Are there any trends and, more importantly, is there anything you can do to improve your results going forward?
This is why tracking reject reasons can help you gain valuable insight on how to fix your process and train your team. 
Today, we’re sharing how our clients use HubSpot to track and visualize this data so they can make smarter decisions for their landscaping business.
Bonus: We have an later in this article! See what happens if you improve your closing percentage!
You should only pursue leads worth your time and resources. 
This for the BANT+P method can help your team consider if a lead is worth their time.
  * Budget: Does the prospect have a reasonable budget for the work they require?
  * Need: Does the prospect truly need your services, or are they just window shopping?
  * Timing: Are their expectations for service delivery aligning with your sales process and production timeline?
  * Positioning: Does this client and the services they require align with your ideal client profile?


Once you've properly qualified your leads, the next step is to track how they move (or don’t move) through your sales pipeline. 
There are multiple reasons why conversations end without signing on the dotted line. Instead of diving into every single one, we’ve compiled a general list of possible causes for rejection. 
Some of these issues can be tackled in your marketing or on your website. However, many of them lead to potential sales processes and coaching improvements. 
  * Out of Area: Contact is not in your service area.
  * Service Not Offered: Prospect wants a service you don’t provide.
  * Unable to Contact: The prospect submitted a form or called but was not reachable.
  * Competitor: Another provider responded first or gave them a better deal.
  * Price: Prospects don’t feel the value of what you provide is aligning with what they are willing to pay. 
  * Under Minimum: Prospect wanted a project under your minimum level of engagement


This list can be much longer, and every company may have its own unique set of challenges. The key is tracking these rejection reasons systematically to understand recurring patterns.
HubSpot can make a deal Closed-Lost reason a required property. So, for a sales associate to close out a deal, they must first select one of the pre-selected reasons. 
This is great when deals are actually moved to Closed-Lost, but what about stalled deals that just sit in a previous stage? You can’t trust your metrics if your sales pipeline is clogged with deals that should be closed out or reassigned. 
Reps often leave deals sitting in the Estimate or Proposal Sent stage with hopes they will convert at a later date because the lead was qualified and seemed interested. But sometimes it is best to cut your losses and follow up at a later date. 
HubSpot can also be configured with triggers that alert sales managers when a deal is sitting at a certain deal stage for a set amount of time and create a task for the assigned deal owner to follow up.
To better analyze rejected deals, it’s important to break down the reasons for rejection by the individuals or teams involved. This can help pinpoint where the problem lies in the process, whether it's with a specific role or across the entire organization.
As you analyze closed lost trends, you may have conversations where a designer tells you that the prospects lost interest after they presented their initial design and it was marked lost due to “Changed Their Mind”. 
  * Perhaps the designer isn’t properly qualifying the prospect before the design stage. 
  * Proposals may not be resonating with the prospect’s needs or preferences. 


HubSpot also includes features that can address these challenges by utilizing:
  * Playbooks: Required forms that collect information about the prospect and opportunity
  * Email Workflows: A series of automated emails triggered by particular pipeline stages, adding value and keeping interest warm.
  * Activity Tracking: Lead intelligence for reps to see how prospects are engaging with emails, proposals, and website pages. 


These trends can also identify specific coaching opportunities for your sales manager. 
Account managers may face numerous reasons for deals not closing. Perhaps they have a client that is interested in an enhancement project. The prospect eventually goes dark and the deal is lost with the “Unable to Contact” reason. 
  * Communication dies after several rounds of playing email and phone tag to set up a meeting.
  * The account manager forgets to reach back again as they’re spending time with hotter opportunities.
  * The rep is taking too long to respond to the contact and they lose interest or complete the project themselves.


  * Meeting Links: Sends the prospect a direct link to the rep’s calendar to book a time to walk the property together.
  * Sequences: A custom group of emails, call reminders or tasks for this specific use case.
  * Activity Reports: Dashboards that show how long it takes for a rep to initiate outreach. 


As always, identifying these Closed-Lost trends can provide coaching opportunities. 
The data from rejected deals is valuable because it provides a clear starting point for improvements across the board. Here's how to make the most of this information:
  * Prequalify leads more effectively: Use insights from rejected deals to refine your lead qualification criteria. This could mean adjusting your marketing strategies.
  * Review your sales process: Regularly assess your team’s approach to selling. Are there patterns in how certain team members handle rejections? Could better coaching, additional resources, or better technology help close more deals?
  * Coach team members: Armed with data from rejected deals, you can provide targeted coaching to individuals. Your team may need additional support in proposal development, establishing rapport, or uncovering needs.


The key is to view each rejection as an opportunity for improvement. By analyzing the trends in why deals are lost, you can continually fine-tune your sales processes, train your team better, and ultimately close more deals.
Use this calculator to analyze your proposal closing percentage and see how improving it could impact your revenue. 
  1. Then, enter what your desired closing % should increase to, and see the potential results if you improved your rate.


Rejected landscaping deals don’t have to be the end of the road. With a solid pre-qualification process, an understanding of why deals are lost, and a data-driven approach to improving your sales strategy, you can reduce these rejections and turn them into opportunities for future success.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/cooks-in-the-kitchen-landscaping-marketing-success

I spent much of my early working years in restaurants. From washing dishes, cooking, and waiting tables, I saw some pretty crazy things, including fist fights in the kitchen.
The spectrum of organizational success was staggering. Some kitchens operated as well-oiled machines and others were a total shit show. The phrase “too many cooks in the kitchen” has a deeper meaning to me. 
It really reminds me of how green industry companies approach their lawn care and landscaping marketing. In a successful kitchen, you need a team, each doing a great job based on their particular skill set. Someone needs to lead. Others tend to specific details. There is a flow. There are tested processes people follow. But how do you pull this off well at your organization?
While hiring a landscaping or lawn care marketing agency is a great first step, involving your team in the process adds another layer of effectiveness.
The question is: who from your team should be involved, and how do you ensure the collaboration is productive?
Today, I’m going to share some tips to answer those questions and build your internal team. 
At the core of any successful marketing strategy is a strategic leader. Most lawn care and landscaping company owners have little to no experience at creating an effective, comprehensive marketing strategy. This is why they find partners to spearhead their efforts.
A great will know how to bring out the best in your team whether it’s two or ten people involved. 
However, your ownership should always be involved with high-level strategy. These individuals ensure the marketing plan aligns with overall business goals and sets the tone for execution. 
The owner doesn’t need to carry the burden alone. Bringing in a trusted administrator or sales manager can offload tasks such as organizing files, managing logistics, and pulling customer lists—freeing the owner to focus on strategy.
Image Source: Rob Reindl, from , leads effectively by involving his VP of sales, technicians, and others in various marketing initiatives we execute for him.
Having at least one or two people in these strategic and administrative roles is essential for effective collaboration with your marketing agency. These roles act as the bridge between your team and the agency, ensuring seamless communication and execution.
[RELATED READING: [When to Hire In-House Marketing Help -and, How Much to Pay]](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/hire-pay-in-house-marketing)
Subject matter experts (SMEs) bring a wealth of knowledge to the table, especially in technical areas like irrigation, hardscaping, or pest control. 
For example, your irrigation manager could provide detailed insights about the latest eco-friendly practices, while a landscape designer might contribute ideas for showcasing design trends.
Image Source: CEO, Krisjan Berzins from , relies on specialized experts such as landscape designer, Alan Macbeth, to ensure well-rounded perspective is applied when needed. 
If you’re a smaller company, you might wear the SME hat yourself. In larger organizations, don’t hesitate to tap into your team’s deep well of expertise. Featuring diverse voices in your marketing materials not only adds credibility but also engages your audience with authentic, informative content.
Selecting the right people to contribute to lawn care and landscaping marketing efforts is crucial. While it’s tempting to involve everyone, too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to inefficiencies and decision fatigue. 


For instance, an operations manager could make sure that properties are ready for a video or photoshoot, an admin could buy the props and ensure everything runs smoothly, and an account manager might reach out to clients to get them to participate.
Image Source: Michael Tomaino, Head Gardener at , delegates various project aspects to his team to ensure their photo and video shoots are a success.
The key is to delegate tasks to the right people without overloading them or micromanaging the process.
When your team is involved in the landscaping or lawn care marketing process, they’re more likely to feel a sense of ownership and pride. This investment can lead to a deeper commitment to the overall success of your campaigns. 
Each team member offers a unique perspective—whether it’s insights from the field, client feedback, or technical expertise—that enriches your marketing strategy.
Image Source: Jack Moore, President & CEO of , has regular discussions with his team which often provides a unique opportunity for content marketing assets.
For example, a salesperson might highlight frequently asked customer questions, which can inspire valuable blog topics to leverage during the sales and marketing process. Meanwhile, a crew leader could help capture some before and process images that you can use in a future case study article. 
Finding the right balance between team involvement and efficiency is critical. While collaboration fosters creativity and investment, too many voices can lead to slow decision-making and frustration.
Aim to involve two or three key individuals for consolidated feedback. This approach streamlines communication with your marketing agency and avoids the chaos of managing input from a larger group. If additional team members have ideas, hold internal meetings to filter and organize their suggestions before presenting them to your lawn care or landscaping marketing agency.
Image Source: Marion Delano, Director of Technology & Marketing at , does a great job at running point on all campaigns and leaning on multiple team members for additional perspective. 
Every successful marketing effort needs a clear decision-maker to lead the charge. This person, often the owner or a senior manager, serves as the final authority on which ideas move forward and how resources are allocated.
  * Set expectations early. Team members should understand that not every idea will be implemented, but their contributions are valued.
  * Trust the process. Encourage your team to rely on the expertise of your marketing agency while offering constructive input.
  * Keep the team focused. Avoid getting sidetracked by unnecessary details or overanalyzing minor elements.


Marketing campaigns thrive on momentum, and deadlines are essential to maintaining it. Your landscaping and lawn care marketing agency will set timelines for reviews and feedback, and it’s important to honor these deadlines. Delayed input can stall the entire process, leading to missed opportunities.
Image Source: Brent Ackors from sets clear expectations with his team, driving home the importance of them all hitting their deadlines for campaigns.
To avoid confusion, involve key team members early in the planning stages and provide them with summaries of major decisions. This ensures they understand the direction of the campaign and can offer informed feedback without revisiting settled matters.
Using collaboration tools can simplify communication and keep everyone organized. We use platforms like Google Docs which allow team members to suggest edits and add comments in real time. Likewise, project management tools like Basecamp keep tasks, deadlines, and discussions in one centralized location.


Working with partners and team members has the potential to leave a bad taste in your mouth. Or, it can be a memorable experience that people talk favorably about for years to come. It all comes down to how you approach your growth strategy and campaigns.
Image Source: Paul Welborn, owner of keeps his team informed about various marketing initiatives and gives them opportunities to collaborate throughout the year. 
By thoughtfully selecting team members, fostering collaboration, and balancing input with efficiency, you create a marketing strategy that reflects the expertise and passion of your entire company.
With a clear leader, streamlined processes, and the right tools, your marketing efforts can bloom into something extraordinary. Whether you’re showcasing stunning landscapes, sharing insider knowledge, or telling your company’s story, the involvement of your team is the secret ingredient to success.

_"What a great article on consultation fees! We’ve been using this strategy for two years. Not only does it do everything you stated in the article, charging a fee has opened up hundreds of hours per year of new time to work on my company as opposed to meeting with potential clients that have absolutely no intention of buying our services. Our close ratio went from 40% to 80% almost instantly when we implemented this strategy."_ ~ Carson Browning, 
I love getting feedback like this from readers. Keep your comments coming.
Now, let’s talk about charging a fee for your landscape design expertise.
**Keep in mind, you’re in a unique position because of that expertise. It’s “creative” expertise**. This is very different than expertise in a productized or commoditized service like lawn care, tree care, or commercial landscape maintenance ().
Creativity is valued. And because "value is subjective and entirely personal" (Enns, , 2018), you can get “creative” in how you charge for landscape design. More on that in a minute.
## The traditional (lazy) approach to (not) charging for landscape design
There are many ways to offer your landscape design services to customers.
Many landscape companies gift free design as their foot-in-the-door offer, simply considering it a cost of doing business. Of course, customers view it exactly the same way and will treat it as such (hint: that of having minimal value).
  1. Have limited design chops that make you indistinguishable from your competitors and/or...


Then there are companies who charge a low, flat fee – say $500 – for a landscape plan.
_“We don’t actually value our expertise. We’re just charging you an arbitrary $500 because we’re really busy right now and we think this will either qualify or disqualify you from doing business with us.”_
**You’re selling design as a commodity, when instead you should be pricing it like a creative**.
Most professional landscape designers and landscape architects will use a cost-based pricing model when selling their services, either charging design fees based on direct inputs (time x hourly rate) or a lump-sum fee based on an estimate of time.
I alternated between each when I owned my landscape design firm. I charged a lump-sum up front based on my estimated time and then charged for revisions on an hourly basis.
I found that charging for my design time on an hourly basis tended to be viewed as risky by clients because the fee could be seen as being open-ended.
**This cost-based approach is preferred over the previous two mentioned because you actually capture your costs (and hopefully a profit) and put yourself in the enviable and valued expert position**.
Let’s get back to what I said about pricing your landscape design fees in a creative way.
**This will require that you follow two rules from here forward:**
  1. **You will price each client and their project uniquely by...**


In doing so you will eliminate the lazy and arbitrary flat rate $500 design approach and move beyond the cost-based approach of charging by the hour.
"Offering options" refers to bundling your design services into three unique scopes of work, ranging from the most basic offering (ex.- plan-view design) to one with the most value (ex.- plan-view design + 3D renderings + construction details).
Then you allow your client to choose what scope (i.e.- option) and cost they are most comfortable with.
"One of the biggest pricing mistakes that creative professionals make is to put a proposal in front of the client that contains only one option. In such a take-it-or-leave-it proposition there are only two outcomes, 50% of which are positive and 50% of which are negative." (Enns, , 2018)
Improve your chances by offering three options instead of one. **It's much more difficult for your client to walk away from three options than it is to slam the door on a single option**.
With a take-it-or-leave-it approach you also risk scaring off the sensitive "price buyer". I've personally found myself in this position more than once. There's no reason for it. Presenting a lower cost option specifically for this price buyer will allow you to close a higher percentage of proposals (without giving away value and profit).
The opposite of a "price buyer" is a "value buyer", with whom perceived value is more important than cost.
When you offer free design – or a flat rate fee of let's say $500 – you only appeal to price shoppers, while ignoring value buyers. This common mistake is leaving substantial amounts of money on the table.
We can illustrate this with a client who has a stated budget of $100k to $150k for their landscaping project. You may propose a $1,000 flat rate fee for the design work while a competitor offers it for free. If this is a value buyer he or she is most likely willing to pay at least $5,000 for the landscape plans. Yet you settled for $1,000.
This is why you price each client differently and why you always include an option in your proposals specifically for the value buyer.
### 3. You will put your competitors at a distinct disadvantage
When I had my design firm I loved it when I would go up against companies offering their landscape design services for free. I had the advantage. Why? – I would actually charge for landscape design.
With that in mind, now imagine presenting your client with a proposal that includes three options to work with you (compared to your competitor's freebie option).
**By controlling the comparisons you marginalize your competitors proposals even more**.
Read that last sentence again. It's the most important point in this article. We'll go more in depth on this point in the next article so .
### 4. You will eliminate time spent on (perceived) low value deliverables
Not all of your clients expect or want to pay for color-rendered plans or 3D computer renderings. Some don't even want a detailed plant list.
Landscape designers make this mistake of over-delivering time and time again. I did the same thing.
**If done properly, bundling your landscape design services into three options ensures your client gets exactly what they want (and nothing more) and you get compensated for all value provided**.
Along with , this creative approach to pricing your landscape design services will make you a helluva lot more money.
And, frankly, this is exactly what you deserve as an expert in your profession. 
Making a fair profit is in your hands, not your clients. It requires a approach to everything you do, including pricing. I know you're not lazy, so stop pricing like it.
In the next article I'll dive deep into how to bundle and price your options (UPDATE: of this series). if you're not already on our list. Or just add your email address to the form below.
Are you intrigued by this approach to pricing? This creative pricing strategy can be used for all of your services, not just landscape design fees. That should get your imagination running :) **to learn how we help lawn and landscape companies develop and implement creative pricing strategies like this**.

# 16 Lawn Care Lead Generation Strategies (Ranked Best to Worst)
often carries with it a degree of experimentation. Unfortunately, trial and error can mean wasted money, time, and missed opportunities to . You already put so much blood, sweat, and tears into growing a lawn care business. The last thing you want is to rub salt in the wound with tactics that pan out to be a colossal waste of time (and money). I get it. I’ve spent 20+ years in the lawn care industry, with almost half of that time spent in marketing roles. In my previous position at a $13M company, we experimented with all sorts of lawn care lead generation strategies. Some were huge successes and others were unfortunate failures.
Since coming to Landscape Leadership in 2016, I’ve helped dozens of green industry companies grow their lawn care businesses. I’ve been personally involved with parts of their strategy and they have shared insights into their campaigns (and results) outside of the services we offer.Some of our clients’ campaigns have been impressive...others didn’t pan out so well. There are a lot of variables and different companies often have different results.But I sincerely commend any company’s courage and openness to try new marketing strategies. You often never know until you try.Today, I want to share what I and other green industry professionals have learned to be the 16 best (and worst) lawn care lead generation strategies (ranked best to worst). I’ll give them a 1 through 5-star rating.
Your website has two goals, 1) to attract prospective clients and 2) turn those website visitors into qualified leads for your sales team. Lawn care SEO (search engine optimization) is a widely misunderstood and oversimplified term. The core concept is that implementing certain online strategies both on and off of your lawn care website will allow it to appear higher in organic search results for hundreds of phrases consumers will enter into search engines.
Traffic is great, but you should also be converting anywhere from 1-3% of all website visitors into a qualified lead. If you are finding that isn’t the case, it could point to fixing major flaws with the user experience, images, videos, and copywriting. If you do this right, organic website traffic and lawn care leads will increase over time to deliver results for years to come.
  * An ample amount of time needs to be invested when building your website. If you’re getting a quote under $12,000 for a new website, it’s a good sign there isn’t much SEO research or quality copywriting involved.
  * Consistently creating useful, long-form blog content over the years can help you to rank for hundreds of search terms. A great content strategy with remarkable content requires expertise that’s worth investing in.
  * Set up online directory listings with Google My Business, social media profiles, etc. Make sure you have a consistent company name, address, phone, website, etc. listed. Search engines love this validation.


  * Use high-quality, professionally-created visual and written content. You’re a lawn care expert. Hire some pros that do these things better and stick to what you do best.
  * Everything on your website should call visitors to action. Whether it’s continuing their research or getting a quote, make this experience easy for them.
  * Test and refine your strategy. A great lawn care marketing agency can identify problems and make improvements to get more lawn care leads over time.

These ads that appear at the top of search results can be a great way to increase visits to your website and resulting leads while you are working to improve your organic traffic. However, Google Ads (also referred to as Pay-Per-Click or PPC) can result in a poor ROI if you don’t take the right approach. This lawn care lead generation strategy works best for services like lawn care that have a short sales cycle, high sense of urgency, and smaller price tag. If you do this correctly, you should be getting a cost per lead of $10-$35 for Google Ads (outside of what an agency charges for management).
  * Budget for a minimum of $1,500 per month with Google. Otherwise, your ads won’t show up many times per day. Some competitive, well-populated markets will demand this. And for the smaller markets, it’s better to have it allocated and not use it than to not show up.
  * Pay an agency to spend 5-10 hours per month working on improvements. A low management fee could mean they just send you an automated report with no insights or strategic changes.
  * Experiment with different ad copy to see what works best.
  * Create and refine landing pages to convert more clicks into leads.


(View entire video playlist, comments, links, etc. regarding )
Sending postcards can be a great lawn care lead generation strategy. A carefully executed campaign should result in a 1.5 -3.5% return. This means if you’re sending 10,000 lawn care postcards, you should be getting 150-350 new lawn care leads. If that’s not happening, there is an issue with your list, timing, offer, design, or website landing page.
  * Keep your design simple, with one image on each side, a compelling and clear offer, customer-focused messaging, and multiple methods to contact you.
  * Use QR codes to make it easier for prospects to get to the right landing page on your website.
  * Direct prospects to a landing page on your website that has the most important information, a form, and the call tracking number.
  * Use social proof like a great Google Review on postcards.


Each technician traveling through prime target neighborhoods will be parked in front of 20-30 homes a day. Use their vehicles to reinforce your brand recognition.
Wrap your vehicle in a unique but tasteful fashion. Don’t overdo or underdo this.
  * Pay for a great professional design, even if that means using an outside graphic designer. Not all sign shops are great at this. Ask to see examples of their work.
  * Be sure your logo is big enough to be seen when traveling down the street. Phone and website addresses are great, but they’re most likely going to do an internet search for your brand name.
  * Be sure to also wrap the back of your trucks.
  * Opt for new fleet vehicles with ample surface areas. Flatbed trucks may need additional panels for this prime lawn care advertising real estate.

When that lawn care truck is finished treating 10-15 lawns in that neighborhood, make sure the neighborhood knows. Doing this throughout the year is a great way to reinforce your presence for multiple days after the treatments are completed.
  * Go big. If you’re doing lawn care treatments, use a sign 6” or larger. Some of our clients even post ones that are 8.5” x 11”
  * Post them along the street/sidewalks where people will see them.
  * Opt for the extra protective coating so they last longer and won’t easily droop or fade.
  * Include your logo and only legally required info. People won’t stop there to call you or go to your website. They’re going to search online for your brand.


If you’ve done a great job over the years collecting emails from prospects and customers, be sure to capitalize on being able to reach out to them from time to time.
Sending seasonal tips and offers can be a great way to increase your average customer value with add-on services and also can re-engage past estimates or canceled customers.
  * Try to be helpful. There will be times for subtle promotions but don’t annoy people by begging for their business.

Just creating a lawn care referral program won’t be enough. You will have to consistently and tastefully promote it. Make it worthwhile for your customers to refer friends and family members.
  * Create a very compelling reward that they’ll remember and is different than your competitors.
  * Give options for them to submit referrals in multiple ways (phone, website, etc.)
  * Thank your customer for every referral they send whether it sells or not. A hand-written card is a nice touch.

Up until this point, my recommendations are what I would consider the absolute critical ways to get lawn care leads. Social media is where I start to waver in my recommendations. In times when demand is at its peak, Facebook ads can be a viable lawn care lead generation tool. However, in my experience and that of our clients, these ads are typically more costly than a properly-run Google Ad campaign. Proceed with caution and measure your results.Just posting to Facebook or other social media platforms can be useful but I wouldn’t hang your hat on its abilities to generate a ton of great leads for your lawn care business. Compare this to items 1-7 above and you’ll see social media users often don’t have the same level of intent as someone who is actually searching online for lawn care services.
_Look at these graphs below. The first shows website visits by traffic source. You can see social media (teal) is a relatively small number of visits. This client puts A LOT of time into posting to social media. Then look at the second graph. This shows how many leads actually come from social media. You can see that it doesn't have the same impact as organic traffic or paid search via Google Ads. It can work, but just make sure you have realistic expectations._

Platforms like HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List, Thumbtack, Yelp, Houzz, and others promise lawn care companies that they will help them show up in search results and get lots of lawn care leads. In both my experience and that of most of our clients, these lead generation websites offered fewer lawn care leads and also had a higher cost per lead than investing in Google Ads or improving your own website. It all comes down to you being able to realize what your cost per lead is and ultimately how many of these you actually sell.
I’ve tried this multiple times and several of our clients have as well. I think radio ads can have some value to reinforce other advertising campaigns you may be running. They see your trucks, signs in yards, get a postcard in the mail, and then hear your radio spot. Then you just hope the prospect actually mentions the radio ad, not the most memorable of the items above. People are unlikely to pull over or drop what they’re doing to call on your radio ad. I’m not saying you shouldn’t run them, just consider your ROI and priorities. I also have seen that radio ads work best for established companies that have a lot of brand equity built up over 10+ years.
This falls into the same category as the radio ads above. It can be a good way to , but it may not yield a ton of leads.One exception could be to place ads in coupon clipper magazines for a limited time. Just know that your offer and your ad need to be very impressive to stand out. You may also attract customers that are very motivated by cost. That may not align with your positioning.
Here’s where you’re going to find my strong objections beginning for the rest of our list. I think it’s awesome to support your community. But just do this for the sheer purpose of giving back. This is not a good way to generate leads and often requires a big investment for people to really remember you. People don’t often choose contractors because they sponsored their kids’ sports teams. They choose them because of what they learn about them on their websites, referrals from friends, and Google reviews and ratings
[RECOMMENDED READING: ]
Placing these ads on busy roadways can be an ego boost when people tell you they saw your billboard. However, billboard advertising can be expensive and people are focused on getting somewhere safely. How many times have you remembered a billboard?I’m not saying there’s no place for this but it all comes back to priorities and ROI. It can be a good way to maintain your brand’s leadership position in your market but don’t count on a ton of lawn care leads from these.
I can’t believe in 2021 and beyond we still need to talk about this, but we do. These companies have quite the sales pitch and a ton of empty promises. Barely anyone uses these anymore and if you do the right thing with item 1 on our list, you can accomplish way more. The only thing I’d recommend here is to claim and complete any of their free online directories they may offer.
I’ll be honest, I do have one client who uses television ads and I have done so in the past. They’re useful in peak seasons but the cost is very high both for great production and running these television spots. These may be a good way to defend your well-established brand position, but it’s not something I’d recommend for new lawn care lead generation efforts. Plus, with people spending so much time with streaming apps and on-demand video, they’re very likely to never see your commercial. Again, these types of ads work best for established companies that have a lot of brand equity built up over 10+ years.
Ads that follow you around online are annoying and intrusive. I’ve tried these in the past and also have had clients place them. The cost is minuscule but the results are even less. I’d focus your lawn care lead generation efforts on something you can get a better lead conversion rate (Google Ads) instead of 0.010% like you’ll see with retargeting ads. FYI, I’ve been on some of your websites and your ads are following me around. I don’t even live in the same state! That’s some great targeting there...
One of the most common questions I get is, “Chad, what do you think about ____?” (fill in the lawn care lead generation strategy)Well, now you know. My opinions have come from spending millions of dollars on marketing and advertising campaigns. At my prior job, my success or failure is what drove my raise, bonuses, and keeping my job. (Oh, and I wasn’t fired LOL)These opinions have been reinforced by what I’ve seen dozens of some of the most successful lawn care companies doing. Don’t keep wasting your money on lawn care lead generation strategies that get poor results. Learn from all of our mistakes and successes. However, leave room for some experimentation.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/landscaping-content-marketing-strategy-blunders

As you’ve grown in your lawn care, tree service, or landscaping career you probably have some “blunders”. I know I have my own tales to tell.
A "blunder" refers to a careless or serious mistake, typically one that is made as a result of a lack of attention, judgment, or skill. These , sometimes significant, negative consequences could have been avoided with more careful planning or consideration.
Most (if not all) green industry companies have blunders when it comes to creating content.
So what is sabotaging the content marketing strategy for your , , or ? 
Let’s get some definitions and important facts out of the way first before I give you insights. 
  * 68% of online experiences begin with a search engine ().
  * 76% of marketers report that content marketing generates demand/leads ().
  * 70% of people rather get information from blogs than traditional advertisements ().
  * Over the past 16+ years, Landscape Leadership has created thousands of blog articles for dozens of green industry companies (landscaping, lawn care, tree service, pest control). 
  * I’ve personally written hundreds of blog articles over the past 15 years. This has taught me a lot of lessons (which I’m happy to share with you).


  * Content Marketing: I am referring to written content in the form of blog articles, case studies, guides, and other long-form written content. These principles can also apply to your website copywriting, video scripts, and social media but are not the focus of this article.
  * Strategy: Content marketing strategy begins before ever typing a word of a blog post or other written content. The strategy will be implemented within your creative concepts and processes, but we are staying higher level in this article. 


Now that we have that squared away, let’s dive into some tips to help you succeed in your content marketing strategy.
Many green industry companies embark on their content marketing journey without clear goals, as if wandering down a maze, not sure of where they'll end up. 
The absence of specific objectives to grow particular divisions of your business means your content strategy may lack focus, diluting its potential impact. 
For instance, if you create 48 articles per year and try to divide topics into 6-7 service departments, it slows progress. Focus on 1-3 main service divisions and have your content marketing strategy reflect that.
  * Embed Content in Your Culture: Content creation should be integral to your company's ethos, championed by leadership, and embraced across all departments. 
  * Brand Content Identity: Aim for your brand to become synonymous with helpfulness and quality, positioning yourselves as a useful resource for your audience. 
  * Recognize Limitations: Your team has limitations in time and expertise. This is why seeking specialized external support from a lawn care and can provide the guidance needed to craft an impactful strategy.


[RELATED READING: [5 Reasons Why Your Salespeople Need to Start Blogging - Like Yesterday](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/5-reasons-your-salespeople-need-to-start-blogging)]
A common pitfall is a vague definition of who your content marketing is for. This ambiguity leads to marketing efforts that miss the mark, failing to connect with any group effectively.
  * Develop Buyer Personas: Create detailed buyer personas (semi-fictionalized characters) to guide your content from topic choice to tone. There may be several personas to address potential commercial landscaping prospects. Likewise, your residential audience may have a couple of different buyer types. 
  * Create Messaging Guidelines: Utilize frameworks like "" (as Landscape Leadership has done since 2019) to create engaging content and establish a brand voice that resonates with your audience. A clear understanding of your audience informs not just what you write about, but how you present your information. It also helps you create content marketing that is recognizable and unique. 


[RELATED READING: [See How Easily You Can Use These 5 Elements of Storytelling to Sell More Work](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/5-elements-of-storytelling)]
Many lawn and landscaping companies attempt DIY content creation or employ freelance writers who might lack strategic insight. Or (worse), they see content as a commodity to buy on “the cheap” by unqualified writers or spit out crap . 
This often results in sporadic output or superficial "thought-ish" content that fails to deeply engage readers. 
[RELATED PODCAST: [Thoughtful vs. Thoughtless Content & How to Leverage It Internally](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/thoughtful-vs-thoughtless-content-marketing-how-to-leverage-internally)]
  * Consistent Creation: Aim to produce 3-6 articles monthly, supplemented by larger content marketing resources throughout the year. Stick to your deadlines!
  * Create Atypical, In-depth Content: Aim for 800-2,000 word articles. There is evidence that suggests that short content doesn’t perform as well (). Make it your goal to create the best possible resource that trumps what your competition is churning out. 
  * Promote Content: Recognize content as a chance to connect and leverage evergreen pieces for ongoing engagement on social channels. Don’t just post them one time and never reuse them. When sharing, add unique context in your intro text in social posts. 
  * Enhance Written Content With Multimedia: To create more engaging content, add 5-10 professional photos that illustrate points and feature your team and clients. Likewise, adding relevant professional videos can help clients spend more time on your content marketing assets (a great signal to Google). 
  * AI as a Tool: Only use AI to improve the quality of your strategy, not replace the nuances of a human-guided approach.


[RELATED READING: [10 Things Landscaping Salespeople Shouldn’t (& Should) Do on LinkedIn](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/10-things-landscaping-salespeople-shouldnt-should-do-on-linkedin)]
Understanding your audience is one thing; making your content easily discoverable online is another. 
Many companies neglect lawn care and landscaping SEO best practices, undermining their efforts to establish "topical authority" in the eyes of search engines. 
  * Incorporate SEO Intelligently: To create topical authority, develop “content clusters”, centering around a larger “pillar page”. These content marketing assets will likely be 3,000-4,000 words, serving as an overview and linking to the cluster’s “spokes”, detailed blog articles that dive deeper as well as other pages on your website. 
  * Link Back to Pillar Pages: Likewise, your blog articles and pages should link back to these pillar page resources. This helps Google understand the interconnection of various pages and articles on lawn care and landscaping websites.
  * Use Location-Based Terms: There are times to naturally integrate geographic references into your content marketing. Using local terms in some articles and case studies can enhance local SEO. 


Many lawn and landscape companies have a lack of understanding regarding content marketing metrics. This oversight leads to missed opportunities for optimization and improvement.
  * Identify Content KPIs: Seek to understand how many views and what level of engagement is considered a success. 
  * Get the Right Tools: Utilize tools such as HubSpot and Google Analytics to track how content is performing. 
  * Re-optimize & Re-write: Regularly revisit content. Re-optimizing content (slight changes) can significantly boost its performance. Acknowledge that not all content will excel; some may require rewrites. Submit these changes to Google Search Console.


I hope as you start to face your content marketing blunders, you give yourselves some grace. Heck, I do this for a living and I have plenty of hard lessons and mistakes that have taught me these principles. 
The goal is to use your failures (or inaction) to propel you forward. This is what it takes to develop a successful content marketing strategy.
Set great goals. Find the right partners. Get to intimately know your audience. Invest in quality and consistency. Understand SEO best practices. And measure and adjust your strategy as time goes on.

# How to Add Pest Control Services: 10 Tips for Lawn Care Companies
In the past 20+ years that I’ve been in the lawn and landscape industry, I’ve noticed a growing trend in which many lawn care companies and even some landscapers are adding pest control services to their offerings.
After all, if you are already maintaining your customer’s property as a trusted partner, why not offer them more ways you can help them while growing your lawn care or landscape business with a highly-profitable new service line?
Personally, I worked at a full-service firm that added, inside-out pest control services. It was so successful that it grew to about $1.2 million in annual revenue in just about seven years. It was also one of our most profitable departments with the lowest cancellation rates.
Here at Landscape Leadership, I’ve also worked with a handful of lawn care and landscaping companies that have added pest control services. 
If this is something you’d like to do at your company, I’ve rounded up some tips for you.
## 1. Determine What Kind of Pest Control You Will Offer
  * Exterior treatments only (perimeter pest control, mosquito control, flea and tick control)
  * Full-blown pest control (inside-out treatments, rodents, termites, bed bugs, and all of the exterior services I’ve mentioned above).


In my opinion, I am an advocate for the full-blown method. It could be my biased experience, but I think you will be less apt to lose a quote to a “real” pest control company that can service other needs. 
Even if you decide to get into some more advanced pest control services like bed bugs, termites, or bird control later, there’s a lot of core services you could miss out on if only addressing exteriors.
I understand that this option carries additional licenses, insurance, and other ramifications. But if you’re contemplating , this is my recommendation to run with the big dogs.
Although you may have some familiarity with product active ingredients, servicing customer properties, and equipment, the value a seasoned pest technician can bring to the table is invaluable. 
_([Joshua Tree wrote a blog article about their new pest control expert ](https://www.joshuatreeexperts.com/blog/meet-brian-gillette-pest-control-service)and emailed it to their customers)_
You’ll soon figure out that, just like lawn care, there is more than meets the eye. It’s not simply applying products. There will be situations, solutions, and approaches that someone in the pest control industry will already know. This can save you a lot of time, money, and aggravation.
I’d recommend hiring someone to start servicing the new accounts and handling the division’s operations. As the customer base grows, they can hire and train new technicians and eventually get out of the field as they find replacements that work out well. 
Whether you decide to , there are going to be challenges. Read the article in the link above to learn the pros and cons of each along with some recommendations.
_(When you visit the and navigate to any , you'll see the branding slightly changes.)_
To prospective customers and search engines, not having the words “pest control” in your company’s name may create some difficulty and confusion. I’m not saying it’s impossible to grow without changing this, but you’re going to have to be very clear in most of your company marketing assets to concisely communicate what you do. Keep that in mind.
As you can see, includes this in their company name and logo. Since this is primarily the two services the company provides, it’s pretty clear.
I would also add the new service offering to your list of categories in Google My Business. 
GMB allows you to select more than one category. Just keep in mind that one of these is a primary category and you will need to determine which one best defines your business. That should also reflect the same focus as your company name.
Consider how you want to sell your programs and how they are priced. [Consumers like things that are easy to understand and buy](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/improving-buying-experience). I recommend developing 3-4 program options. While you may sell a few services, such as termite control, as a single treatment, try to position your services as packages that automatically renew. 
Look at how your competitors are bundling and pricing their services. Don’t duplicate what they have, but create a unique competitive advantage if you can. 
Be sure to provide pricing so prospective customers know exactly what they’re looking at. You may even want to create some add-ons. You may be surprised at how freaked out people are at pests and how willing they are to pay more for more protection!
_(offers add-ons when customers purchase their foundational, Quarterly Pest Control service)._
From your website’s homepage to the individual services pages, pricing pages, quote request pages, etc., you will need to assess if you are clearly showing that you perform pest control services. If you are a lawn care company adding this service, you will want to give this fairly equal treatment to the other services you provide.
You want everyone to quickly assume you’ve always done this service, just like the others. (This also helps these pages to rank better in search results for pest control-related queries.)
For instance, you can see how these companies do so on their website’s homepage. In the case of e, for instance, you can see this right away, visually.
In the case of , you can see this addressed in simple menu navigation choices, and then it also appears lower in the page in a visual manner.
In the case of , who is primarily an irrigation and lawn care company, this service line is one they are still growing, so it’s communicated visually below on their homepage, but very easy to see in the menu navigation.
Just in case someone misses these features, every form on the website has this added as well. This helps reinforce what you do. Instead of giving a laundry list of the things you do, make it easy to mentally digest them a second or two. You can handle the rest of the conversation in the sales process.
## 7. Wrap a Pest Control Vehicle & Update Existing Vehicles
Your new pest control technician may need his own new rig. Make sure to represent what you do on their vehicle. If needed, you may want to address your existing fleet’s messaging as well. Just make sure this is done in a tasteful manner.
_( completely wrapped this van. This will surely get the attention of neighbors!)_
In order to start ranking in search results for pest control, it’s a good idea to start adding pest control topics to your blog’s editorial calendar.
If you’ve done a good job over the past few years of writing a lot of lawn care or landscaping content, you can pull back off of this and put about 75% of your content marketing efforts into pest control articles. Start anywhere from comparing local companies and their solutions, explaining how pest control prices are structured, to discussing specific pests and remedies for getting rid of them. 
Likewise, you’re going to need images and possibly videos to support your image as a reputable pest control company. Some of the images I’d suggest are:
  * Pest technicians with their pest control vehicles in the background
  * Various treatment and inspection pictures as your technicians perform services
  * Stock photos of pests (it’s really hard to get good pics of tiny, elusive critters)
  * Images of pest problems as your technicians encounter them (vole trails, termite damage, spider webs or wasp nests on structures, etc.)


After you capture the necessary pest control images, you may consider creating some video assets.
You’ve worked hard to create great relationships with your existing customers. They will be the easiest people to sell pest control services to since you have that relationship capital.
There are a variety of ways you can promote pest control to them:
  * Send 5-10 emails throughout the year, with a specific focus on pest control. You may want to make a formal announcement, introduce them to your new pest control expert (who has lot of experience), send them exclusive existing customer discounts, and offer up occasional tips on specific pests.


  * You may choose to reinforce your email marketing with something physical you can leave after a lawn care visit or send directly in the mail. Since only 30-60% of people will open your emails, this is a good way to get the point across.


  * It’s all hands on deck when it comes to growing your new pest control division. Since your lawn technicians are on 20-30 properties each day, create an for them to point out pest-related issues to their customers. Homeowners often become friendly with these team members who continuously visit their property. If they leave a note/handout about a wasp nest or vole trails, it may be a really easy sale. 


## 10. Use Digital Advertising to Target New Pest Control Customers
Google Ads are a great way to get your message in front of people who are actively searching online for pest control services. 
However, keep in mind that this is one of the primary ways your pest control competition will advertise. With more competitors, your cost-per-click is going to most likely be much higher than you may be accustomed to paying for promoting other services. 
Make sure you enlist the help of a digital marketing agency that knows what they are doing to get you the most bang for your buck.

It is going to take some time to grow your new pest control division. You may make tweaks and changes as you go but don’t be naive and think you can just do these 10 things and set-it-and-forget-it. As you know, customers often say, “Oh I didn’t realize you did that…”
Keep pointing out ways you can help them and tactfully remind them you’re also in the pest control business.
A mindful approach and diligent efforts will pay off. Stick with it and watch your book of pest control business grow!

# How to Use Humor to Answer FAQs at Your Green Industry Company (Case Study)
Since 2017, we’ve worked with to create hundreds of useful blog articles to answer common questions their prospects and customers have. It’s paid off for them. We’ve seen huge gains.
  * There has been a 311% increase in tree service, lawn care, and pest control leads
  * This translates into hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.


Great blog articles are a foundational must as you can see from the results above. Recently, we decided to take their content marketing strategy to the next level to gain even more traffic and leads. To do this we created educational videos that are also entertaining (edutainment). 
Some of the things I’ve always appreciated about Joshua Malik are his sense of humor and willingness to try new things. I love when company owners don’t take themselves too seriously and understand that their customers are just normal people. Regardless of how affluent customers may be, they can appreciate playful humor while being educated. This style of video is called “edutainment”. I asked Josh, “On a scale of 1-10, one being sterile and factual, and 10 being the most ridiculous video you’ve seen, where do you want to want these videos to land?” He wanted a solid six or seven. I come from a long heritage of dad jokes and punny observations so I knew this was going to be a lot of fun for me to write these scripts. And after I delivered the concepts to Josh, he was all-in.
Here are a few examples of what 20 hours of planning and three days of shooting can get you with the right creative team and an enthusiastic company owner.
Everyone gets frustrated when you go to the doctor and they seemingly guess at what is wrong with you without performing a proper diagnosis. Why not have a little fun with this as it relates to plant health? 
Weeds are annoying. You know what else is annoying? Customers often have unrealistic expectations and don't realize the multi-faceted approach to getting a weed-free lawn. Watch how Josh teaches them while having a little fun. 
Bugs are unwelcome, uninvited guests that show up. Sometimes you wish it was just as simple as not answering the door and just waiting for them to leave. Check out how we had some fun with that while explaining Joshua Tree's pest control service. 
Loving this stuff? If you want to see more examples, check out the .
We all know that it’s important to pre-qualify leads. We also created an Ideal Client video and placed this on . We’re hoping it will deter a few prospects here and there who want half-measures and shop for the cheapest price.
We created nine FAQ videos plus the ideal client video. These videos will be used for:


I would encourage you to not underestimate the power of using humor while educating your audience. Don’t take yourself so seriously. Prospects and customers often don’t remember what you say, but they remember how you make them feel. You and all of your competitors are all vying to be the expert in your market. But how many of you can also be the friendly face that brightens their day and makes them smile?Worried that you’re not a natural comedic actor like Josh? That’s no excuse. There are still ways to pull this off by using a professional actor or other team members.

# 6 Time-Saving Social Media Tips for Lawn Care Companies and Landscapers
Everyone and your mother keeps talking about social media. You wish it was just a fad but the craze keeps building each year. 
Maybe you dabbled, got on the bandwagon, and tried your best to post, pin, update, snap, and whatever else people are doing these days. 
Maybe you got so busy with your lawn care or landscaping business that you got someone else to do it for you. Or maybe it fell to the wayside and you’re now realizing it’s time to spring back into action.
Deep down inside, you’re concerned. You love the concept of building a loyal online community and getting new clients from social media, yet you want to make smart business decisions without wasting time or money.
I get it. I’ve been there myself. In early 2012, I remember standing in front of a room of about 100 coworkers trying to explain how platforms like Facebook and were going to help our lawn and landscape business grow. In the midst of blank stares and raised eyebrows, I tried to convince my co-workers (and secretly, myself) that it was worthwhile.Fast-forward 10+ years later, and these social networks have proven their ability to reach prospective clients. Clearly social media for lawn care businesses or landscapers isn’t a waste of time, if you go about it in the right manner.
Over the years after that speech, I spend a lot of time on social media. I realized one important truth.You only have so much time. And, it’s the one resource you can’t get more of no matter how many lawn care customers you add or how many landscaping jobs you sell. 
So to help you keep from wasting your precious time, here are some time-saving social media tips:
Now while that may sound contrary to your overall goal to spend less time, it’s absolutely necessary to invest more of it on the front-end. Don’t expect a good ROI without doing the groundwork first.Explore your intent for social media and create a detailed plan that will support that purpose on a frequent and consistent basis. Your social media success is dependent upon that and this will direct how you spend your time on a day-to-day basis going forward.
Create a calendar to plan seasonally relevant content. Regardless of if it’s an article, image, or video, your content will fill in predictable slots in this calendar. If you’re just starting out, maybe it’s one or two posts a week. Down the road, it will be easier to post more often.Be consistent and stick to the calendar. Your followers will appreciate it and it will reduce stress for you when it gets busy.
### 2) Start With One Social Platform and Max Out at Two
If you’re attempting to be active on too many networks, you will water down your efforts and waste time. Figure out where your target audience is and narrow your focus. You don’t need to be on every social media platform.
Facebook is ideal for B2C companies and LinkedIn is great for B2B. Become regularly active and engaged on one of those platforms before you move onto others.
Since you’ll have already created a detailed content calendar, you’ll need to find postworthy content. Searching online for something accurate and original can eat up a lot of time. Instead, create your own resources over time.
Regularly produced blog posts, videos, or images of your work or team, is perfect to re-publish later. Organize these items by category and seasonal relevance and it will make creating your content calendar easier each year.
Work ahead when it’s slow. Many social tools like HubSpot, HootSuite, and Buffer allow you to bulk upload messages, links, and images and schedule them out for later.
A little work in the off-season could save you a ton of time when you could get too busy and forget. Many social tools also allow for automatic publishing when you publish a new blog article.
Some social media tools allow you to set up notifications based on certain criteria. Instead of trying to scroll through a giant news feed each day, you can use these tools to notify you when someone mentions your brand or uses specific hashtags near a geographic location.You can also create targeted filters to view only the updates you want to see from specific groups of people or organizations.
Multi-tasking will cause you to be less effective at whatever you’re doing. Weigh your options for being instantly connected carefully. Try to minimize the constant barrage of non-urgent likes and shares as much as possible.
Set scheduled times for you or team members to be active on social media. If the tasks can be divided up among your team members, assign certain duties to be done at the right times.
Social media for lawn care and landscapers makes sense if it’s done right. Putting it off or ignoring it isn’t making it go away. And a causal approach won’t work either.You can be a landscaping or lawn care marketing success if you follow these time-saving tips. You’ll increase your company’s influence, build up a loyal following, and even attract new clients. Then everyone and their mother will be talking about you instead. You’ll be the latest craze.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/how-kd-landscape-revolutionized-selling-commercial-landscaping

Like many commercial landscaping companies, understood efficiency and data-driven decision-making were vital for their growth. This led them to research sales automation and enhanced reporting technology that could supplement their current system.
They turned to Landscape Leadership® for guidance on implementing these tools, because we’re a trusted Hubspot Solutions Partner focused entirely on
The following improvements were all made possible using the HubSpot platform, a customizable suite of tools for sales, service, and marketing. 
KD Landscape faced challenges in effectively tracking and managing their sales activities. They needed:
  * Improved segmentation of sales data to target their market more precisely.
  * Better insights into sales performance to drive effective coaching and strategy.
  * A more streamlined process to manage and follow up on lead


We built custom properties to segment sales data by service type and known lead source. This allowed KD Landscape to gain a clearer understanding of their market and tailor their strategies accordingly. 
If they’re getting a bunch of commercial construction leads from paid search, it may be wise to also run a commercial maintenance campaign to capitalize on growth in the area.
We created a bespoke sales pipeline with well-defined stages and service tags. This structure provided KD Landscape with a clear and consistent process for managing sales opportunities.
And gives them real-time data. We also set up automated task reminders when opportunities reach a certain stage in the pipeline. Such as sending a reminder if deals remain in the proposed stage longer than allotted. 
Because one of their main areas of concern was reporting beyond what their current landscape industry software could provide, we designed a custom report dashboard that includes:
  * Proposed vs. Actual Sales: To compare projected sales with actual outcomes.
  * Sales Rep Activities: To monitor the performance and activities of individual sales reps.
  * Sales and Proposals by Service Divisions: To track performance across different service areas.
  * Closed Lost Reasons: To analyze the reasons behind lost sales and refine strategies.


We also created some proprietary reports for this landscaping client and added filters to the reports for easy access to data by date ranges (month, quarter, year over year). 
Finally, these reports can be automatically shared with company stakeholders and used effectively during weekly sales meetings, enhancing decision-making and strategy.
This report shows total proposed amount, likely to close amount and actual sales for each service division.
KD Landscape has seen tremendous growth in their sales team and achieved record profits.. By recognizing their need for improvement and trusting Landscape Leadership® to guide them, they achieved significant results:
  * Enhanced Data Visibility: Instant access to client data and performance forecasts enabled better-informed decisions and strategic planning.
  * Improved Coaching: The detailed insights and reporting tools facilitated more effective coaching and performance management.
  * Increased Efficiency: Streamlined lead management and reporting processes freed up valuable time, allowing the sales team to focus more on client interactions and closing deals.

The ability to instantly see our company's client data, performance forecast, and activity daily has been a game changer.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/landscaping-lawn-care-sales-process-leaving-money-on-table

In the green industry, it's common to see talented professionals wearing many hats. However, when it comes to sales, juggling too many responsibilities can lead to lost opportunities.
Landscape Leadership®'s and dive deep into this issue, sharing their experiences and insights into why landscaping and lawn care companies may be leaving money on the table due to inefficiencies in the sales process.
As Chris and Chad discuss, many companies in the lawn and landscape industry ask their staff to manage multiple responsibilities beyond their primary roles. This is particularly problematic when it comes to sales.
Chris shares an example from his experience: a landscape designer he knows is not only responsible for creating designs but is also tasked with estimating, selling, project management, and customer service. This overload of duties often pulls people away from what they are best at, leading to inefficiencies in sales.
As Chris aptly points out, “One can only serve one king.” When someone’s time is divided between too many responsibilities, sales tend to take a back seat. And this is a costly mistake.
The designer might be brilliant at crafting beautiful landscapes, but if she’s also responsible for sales, her creative energy is diverted, and the company could lose business simply because she isn’t following up with leads promptly.
Chad shares a personal experience that perfectly illustrates this issue. He contacted two tree service companies to get an estimate for trimming a maple tree in his yard.
Company #1, with whom he already had a relationship, took weeks to respond.
In the meantime, Company #2 quickly provided a quote and completed the job.
By the time Company #1 got back to him, the work was already done. This delay cost the first company the job—and money. 
Image Source: (who does an amazing job at following up on leads)
Chad's example isn’t just about poor follow-up; it’s a systemic issue in the industry. Chris mentions that this salesperson was likely not lazy but had too many other priorities. In many cases, sales simply aren’t treated as the primary responsibility, even for the person officially tasked with it. 
[RELATED READING: [Let's Talk About Who Should Be Selling at Your Lawn Care or Landcaping Business](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/who-should-be-selling)]
Chad introduces four semi-fictional characters, each embodying different common sales challenges in the green industry.
Kate is an expert in plants and design, but she’s notorious for not calling leads back. She’s so absorbed in her creative work that follow-up takes a back seat. As a result, new opportunities sit on her desk for days—or weeks—before she responds, if at all.
Companies with a "Kate" on their team are missing easy wins because there’s no follow-up.
A former crew leader, Jeremy is obsessed with making sure every job is executed perfectly. He spends so much time on-site managing the work he’s already sold that he can’t keep up with his sales quota.
The problem? Jeremy doesn’t trust anyone else to handle the details, and it costs him.
Jody is tasked with answering phones, scheduling, handling customer service, and now—selling lawn care services. The sheer volume of tasks coming her way makes it impossible for her to focus on closing sales.
She ends up being an “order taker,” merely sending out proposals and hoping someone bites.
Image Source: (who does an amazing job at creating specialized, focused roles for their team members)
Tim is a fantastic networker who knows everyone in town, but his love for socializing gets in the way of the nitty-gritty of sales. He rushes through estimates, sometimes fudging the numbers, which leads to problems down the line with operations.
Tim’s laid-back approach might seem charming, but it creates headaches for his company.
Each of these personas is highly relatable to companies in the lawn care and landscaping industry. The core issue with each of these examples is that their sales roles are secondary to their other duties—or at least treated that way. This is a systemic problem in the industry and one that’s costing companies significant revenue.
Chris argues that the green industry needs to rethink how sales are handled. In many other industries, the creative or technical professionals aren’t responsible for selling the work.
Software engineers don’t sell the software they build—experienced salespeople do. Yet, in the green industry, sales are often seen as just another task on an already bloated job description.
Image Source: (who does a great job at creating optimized roles from account managers, landscape designers, to business developers)
For companies to stop leaving money on the table, sales need to be treated as a specialized role. This means having dedicated, trained salespeople who focus solely on building relationships, following up on leads, and closing deals.
When designers, account managers, or administrators are expected to sell in addition to their primary duties, sales suffer.
Even the best salespeople have weaknesses. Maybe they’re great at closing lawn care and landscaping deals but struggle with organization or follow-up. Chad emphasizes the importance of leveraging people, processes, and technology to fill these gaps.For example, if you have a "Kate" on your team who struggles with follow-up, perhaps another team member can handle that aspect for her. Alternatively, technology solutions like CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems can automate reminders and ensure that no leads slip through the cracks. 
Chad talks about how he uses technology to keep track of follow-ups. He uses tools to remind him to reach out to leads, even months later, and to ensure that nothing is forgotten.
By taking advantage of these tools, companies can ensure that they’re not leaving money on the table because of missed follow-ups or disorganization.
### The Importance of Follow-Up: Bonus Interview with Sean from SingleOps
Sean Adams, an industry expert from , emphasizes the importance of follow-up in the sales process. He notes that many companies don’t have a structured follow-up process, and this leads to missed opportunities.
Often, the biggest competition isn’t another company but the customer’s indecision. When potential clients feel overwhelmed by decisions, they tend to put off making a choice. A well-timed follow-up can make all the difference.According to Sean, it’s not just about timeliness but about sending the right message at the right time.
Instead of saying, “You were on my list to call today,” salespeople should provide value in their follow-ups, addressing common questions and showing that they care about the client’s needs.
In the lawn care and landscaping industry, too many companies are losing business simply because they haven’t prioritized sales as a dedicated role.
Talented designers, account managers, and administrators are often asked to take on sales duties, but their strengths lie elsewhere, and the company’s bottom line suffers.
Image Source: (who also has done a great job structuring their roles and process for maximum results)
To stop leaving money on the table, companies should consider restructuring their sales process. By designating trained sales professionals, leveraging technology, and building a solid follow-up process, lawn and landscaping companies can significantly increase their revenue and improve their client relationships. It’s time to stop letting sales fall through the cracks.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/landscaping-sales-kryptonite-poor-preparation

Wouldn’t it be great to have an amazing sales journey at your landscape company? To close more deals, have a process that really works, and build meaningful rapport with prospective clients?
That’s the goal. We all want sales to come easier, with less frustration, and attract ideal clients.But the problem is, there’s something zapping your strength in the sales process. It's your kryptonite.
In the landscaping industry, that kryptonite is poor preparation. Even if you don’t realize it, a lack of intentional planning and process is causing deals to fall apart before they even begin.
Join me, Chad Diller, and sales coach T.M. Dickinson in a recent episode of the Landscape Leadership® Podcast. We'll unpack tips based on 25+ years of experience of selling in the green industry.
A lot of landscape salespeople believe they’re prepared. They’ve been in the industry for years, they know the work, and they know the products.
But in reality, many are going into meetings with assumptions or template approaches, which T.M. Dickinson argues is the root of many sales issues.“Most salespeople are winging it,” T.M. says. “They think all clients are the same, so they go in with a ‘one size fits all’ approach. But every client is different, and proper preparation means knowing that.” Sales interactions, when poorly prepared, feel impersonal and transactional. Imagine someone comes into your home to sell you an HVAC system and pulls out a checklist, treating you like the next stop on their route. It doesn’t make you feel valued. The same goes for . A templated approach won’t cut it. The difference between a good sales interaction and a poor one often boils down to how much you’ve prepared.
When selling landscaping, being prepared means more than just knowing the client wants a patio or outdoor kitchen. It’s about understanding they want it and how they plan to use it.
T.M. shared a great example: “I spoke with a woman who wanted a fire pit and seating wall. At first, it seemed like a simple request to get her husband’s grill off the wooden deck. But as we dug deeper, she revealed the real reason: She wanted a place where her grandkids would want to visit more often. Her emotional why was not about the structure itself, but about creating memories with her family.”By asking thoughtful questions, T.M. discovered the true motivation behind the project, which made his proposal resonate on a deeper level. This is the kind of preparation that turns a lead into a lifelong client.
So, what does proper preparation look like for a landscaping salesperson? Here are a few key strategies that T.M. and I discussed:
Before stepping into any meeting, take time to research the client and their property. Tools like Google Maps and Zillow can give you a visual understanding of their home and neighborhood. T.M. also suggests using platforms like LinkedIn to get a sense of the client’s personality type. “Are they achievement-driven, results-focused, or more people-oriented?” T.M. asks. This can help you tailor your communication style during the meeting, a tactic used in the DISC behavioral assessment framework.
Most landscapers collect basic information like the type of project a client is interested in. But are you using the full range of data available to you? Tools like can show you what pages a client has visited on your website, what blog posts they’ve read, and what emails they’ve opened.
“If I saw that a client is looking at cost articles and case studies on outdoor kitchens,” Chad explains, “I’ll would ask more pointed questions to draw out those interests in the conversation. This type of allows you to connect more effectively.”
A simple but powerful tool in the sales process is what T.M. calls a statement of intent. This sets the stage for the meeting, showing the client that you’ve prepared and have a plan. It also demonstrates respect for their time.Here’s an example: “Mr. Smith, today’s meeting will take about 30 to 60 minutes. I’d like to start by asking you questions about your family and what you want to accomplish with your outdoor space. Then, we’ll go outside to look at the area, and I’ll take some photos and measurements. We’ll wrap up by discussing the next steps. Does that sound good to you?”
This approach not only demonstrates professionalism but also invites the client to give feedback or adjust the plan, which helps build trust and rapport.
Preparation doesn’t stop at gathering data; it’s about asking the right questions during the conversation. T.M. emphasizes the importance of listening 80% of the time and asking thoughtful, open-ended questions that invite the client to paint a picture of their dream space.One of T.M.’s go-to questions is, “What’s driving you to make this decision now?” This question digs into the emotional reasons behind a project, giving you a clearer sense of the client’s priorities.
Follow-up questions like “How will you measure the success of this project?” and “Can you describe what a perfect day in your new space looks like?” help you tailor your proposal to meet their vision.

Great salespeople aren’t born; they’re trained. Just like professional athletes, salespeople need to practice the fundamentals. T.M. points out that mastering the basics—like knowing the client's personality type and asking the right questions—takes discipline and repetition.“There’s a difference between discipline and motivation,” T.M. says. “Motivation fades, but discipline creates habits. Good habits take repetition.”That’s why it’s essential to create a pre-call plan for every sales interaction. This includes doing your research, coming up with specific questions, and crafting a statement of intent. Over time, these habits become second nature, making you more effective in each sales conversation.
At the end of the day, preparation is the antidote to the sales kryptonite plaguing many landscaping businesses. By knowing your client, asking the right questions, and having a solid plan, you’ll build trust, close more deals, and attract the kind of clients who are a perfect fit for your business.
At Landscape Leadership®, we’re committed to helping landscape companies improve not only their marketing but also their sales process.
That’s why we’ve partnered with T.M. Dickinson to offer to our clients. We believe that by mastering the fundamentals of preparation, you can dramatically improve your close rates and reduce the frustration that comes with unstructured sales efforts.

# Lost Opportunities: 3 Things Every Landscaping Sales Manager Should Be Tracking
Ted has been selling landscaping for your company for a long time. He’s a top performer. 
He’s also well connected, frequently name-dropping as he shares networking stories. 
At times, Ted can be found at his desk, working diligently on estimates and making calls. At others, he’s in the field. You don’t micromanage because, after all, he hits his numbers, right?
Sound familiar? Ted is a semi-fictional character based on my decade in the landscaping sales trenches.
I worked with many talented, hard-working salespeople just like “Ted”. Others underperformed for months (even years) until they were let go. They appeared busy but didn’t produce.

My suspicions have been validated as I’ve connected with hundreds of sales professionals in the landscape industry over the past 20+ years. 
  * Your organization measures sales success by relying only on estimated vs. closed revenue reports.
  * Sales teams are often managed by gut instinct and anecdotal evidence.


Growing your landscaping company means successfully executing all of the activities that get you to the estimate phase. Estimates are given to only qualified prospects. Deals are closed within an acceptable timeframe and at a high success rate.
To be an ultimate success as a sales manager, it’s imperative that you know the whole story. If your results are to continuously improve, you’ll need to use more data to influence how you improve your sales processes and team.
There are a lot of good software options out there to help you run your landscaping business. But as I talk to sales managers and company owners they often tell me they’re not getting the full picture from their software. 
Often times they can see estimates and closed revenue but can’t measure other important sales metrics. There is a lack of transparency as communication, notes, and other details are squirreled away in spreadsheets, emails, calendars, and – God forbid – paper notebooks. 
They don’t know where to start to improve the process. Maybe you don’t either. 
Full disclosure, we’re a HubSpot Solutions Partner and for the past seven years, we’ve been utilizing with our clients.
We’ve shared in previous articles how HubSpot’s can help landscaping businesses. 
Today, I’m going to share how can help sales managers and business owners get the important sales-related information they may be missing.
There are often many activities that take place between the prospect and a landscape sales professional before an estimate can be created.
If a sales manager wants to understand what’s happening with each opportunity, it often results in having a lot of conversations with team members. 
This conventional management approach can result in a lot of wasted time and anecdotal evidence. 
One of the valuable benefits of is its ability to connect Outlook 365 or Gmail and Google Calendar with the HubSpot CRM. You can even connect your landline or mobile phone directly with HubSpot. I should also mention that those integrations are .
From a sales manager’s perspective, this means that all activities from these connected tools get documented in the HubSpot CRM. Calls, emails, and meetings all get logged in a contact’s record.

Instead of asking your team members for status updates, it’s more obvious. Measuring sales activity is a breeze with HubSpot’s robust, customizable reporting dashboards.
Sales activity can indicate whether or not a proposal - and sale - is soon to follow. 
If a sales rep is truly productive, HubSpot’s "Rep Activity" reports will be the proof. 
is the measurement of how quickly sales deals move through your pipeline and actually become sold revenue.
tracks these metrics and does a great job of measuring where there is a clog in your sales pipeline. It could be that a low percentage of your completed consultations are reaching the estimate stage, or perhaps proposals sit in limbo waiting for follow-up calls.
You can identify where deals are stalling out by their inactivity. In HubSpot, Deal cards are highlighted when it’s been X amount of days since a salesperson has had contact with a prospect. What good is an estimate if the follow-up is lacking?
Analyzing the clogs in your sales pipeline can help you identify process improvements and sales coaching opportunities. These reports aren’t meant to micromanage but instead help your reps do what they should be doing best: selling and making money!
If you’ve been fishing, you may remember the “one that got away”. Just as you have to master “setting the hook” and fail repeatedly until you get it right, the same is true with sales. 
Granted, there are some “fish” you won’t land. But, there are skills you can improve.
What are the common reasons deals are lost? HubSpot deals can be configured to require a “Lost reason”. Measuring these reasons can help you identify process improvements coaching opportunities. 
Likewise, there may be certain types of work that are harder for one salesperson to close. Heck, tree pruning and removal was the toughest thing for me to learn!
Identifying weak spots by service type can also be valuable. allows you to create custom deal properties such as “service division”. You can easily sort your lost deals by that filter and identify development plans for your team. 
As a landscaping company, you’ve probably already adopted all sorts of technology into your business. You simply don’t do business as you did even five years ago. 
What about your sales organization? If your current technology has you running blind it’s your own success and growth that is at stake. Nothing will change if nothing changes. Will you continue on with your head in the sand?
HubSpot is a tool that we have successfully implemented at landscaping companies with relative ease. We’ve worked with many “Ted’s” and their sales managers who are now pleasantly surprised by the outcomes. If you’re ready to take this step for your landscape company, to learn more.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/marketing-plant-health-care-making-the-invisible-irresistible

You’re a wizard in the world of trees and shrubs—capable of bolstering blooms and flushed foliage, as well as curing the worst plant ailments.
Yet, the irony? Convincing customers to invest in plant health care programs is like persuading kids that veggies are better than candy. It's invisible magic, and the trick lies in making this magic seen.
One major thorn in my side (and likely yours) has been dealing with thousands of home and business owners who don’t pay attention to their trees and shrubs until they’re dead! If my 25+ years in this industry have taught me anything is that selling tree and shrub programs is tough!
And, the greatest challenge before us is getting that point not just across but stuck into the conscious minds of consumers.Today, I’m going to outline some tips for you to get more plant health care leads (and sales) for your business.
Plant health care isn't just about identification, fertilizers, and pesticides. It's the therapy session your garden never knew it needed. So, why do many people see it as an "extra" rather than a necessity? Because it's the industry's worst-kept secret—most don't know they need it until it's too late.
Ever watched a dog food commercial and found yourself tearing up? (yeah…me neither LOL).
That’s an emotional appeal at its finest. Use the same strategy to make plant health care irresistible to your future tree care customers.
  * Create tree service marketing campaigns that tug on the heartstrings. Show images or videos about the special moments created under and around trees. Think tire swings, kids, and puppies. Never underestimate the cute factor. Or just a frosty beer at the end of a hard-working professional’s day underneath (you guessed it) the shade tree over their deck. 
  * Offer some brain candy. Share compelling statistics about how plant health care can increase property value or what the cost of failure is. Replacing that one mature boxwood is merely impossible. They’d have to rip out the whole row and start over. And the prospect of replacing that oak tree on the front lawn? Forget about it! 


I get it…we’re all tree nerds and want to share our wealth of knowledge. After all, that ISA Certified Arborist test was a doozy! But the majority of your prospective clients really don’t care. They just want to preserve these moments and their investment. Start with that. There will be plenty of time to impress them later with your vast technical knowledge. 
[RELATED READING: [See How Easily You Can Use These 5 Elements of Storytelling to Get More Work](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/5-elements-of-storytelling)]
You know what they say—a picture is worth a thousand words. 
  * In a world of scrolling, the perfect image can stop people in their tracks. Use before-and-after pictures to demonstrate the results. Show your friendly team interacting with clients. Paint a picture of a preserved property primed with perfect pines, Pin Oaks, and Prunus (okay, enough with the P’s).
  * Use high-res images and insist on hiring a professional photographer. There are enough poorly-lit, terrible smartphone pics out there. And you’re not going to easily find free-use stock images of leafminers and anthracnose. Create your own library. Trust me, you’ll find multiple ways to use those images over the coming years.


Tell me a tale, and you'll have my ear. Tell me a tale, and you’ll have my business.
  * Tell the tale of plants. Videos can help tell the story of a prized specimen’s decline. Make this an exciting transformation story of how you’re going to not only prevent damage but also how plants can improve over time. Videos are an excellent counterpart to written content. Let’s face it, there are a lot of articles out there. Frankly, a lot of people hate reading. Position a helpful video toward the top of a blog post or website page for a deeper, more visual explanation.
  * Share success stories from satisfied clients. Selling plant health care programs is not just about spraying and injecting. It’s about how a client grew to trust you and how they can now count on you to do what is in their best interest. The only transformation in this story isn’t about trees and shrubs. It’s the tale of your client’s experience with your company.

video below used to promote their tree and shrub care services.
Let's talk options—the “trim levels” of the plant health world. When you shop for a car, you’ll most frequently see three trim levels, each carrying its own set of features.
A core principle of pricing methodology is based on the fact that people have “extremism aversion”. They don’t want the cheapest option for fear of missing out. More may be inclined to go for the top option, but the bulk of consumers choose the middle option. This is why three tiers of tree and shrub care programs work so well. 
And a word about pricing plant health care programs. Stop being so cryptic. I get it. Some of you will have to do a plant inventory to create a customized plan. But you can give a client a starting point with example pricing. Scare away the cheapskates that want two annual sprays. Attract the buyers who understand they’re investing in the long-term value of their plants.

Ah, tree service SEO—the wizard behind the curtain. It makes sure people find you when they go down the Google rabbit hole.
  * It's not enough to have a great service; prospects need to find you online. This means certain keyword phrases need to be found on specific website pages. For instance, if you have one page about “tree fertilizing”, the page name, its description, and text on the page should be honed in on that phrase and related terms.
  * Even though you have a tree service website page that talks about “tree fertilizing”, there are also dozens of other terms you should target. This is where a tree service blog really helps. You could nab that number one spot for “how much does tree fertilizing cost” by creating an article uniquely addressing that topic. 


Remember, the goal of SEO is to establish topical authority over time. No other tree service website should address all of these topics better than yours does!
_Below is an example of how uses their blog to not only improve SEO but to educate prospective clients._
I’ll be honest. This is a tough nut to crack. You’re really going to have to keep an eye on a few things when it comes to tree service Google Ads:
  * Aim for a target under $40/lead. If that’s not happening your digital marketing agency may be asleep at the wheel, not making monthly improvements to ad copy, bidding strategy, and landing pages. And, make sure you’re actually getting appointments for estimates. 
  * I’ve found that tree services are pretty aggressive with PPC ads. Think of this as a game of poker. You have to have enough daily budget. If you only have $1k per month, that’s only $33 per day. A few clicks could exhaust your daily budget by the time you finish your morning coffee. I recommend allocating a minimum of $2-3k per month (even more if you can). 


I’ve seen Google Ads work best for acute problems you can actually fix, not necessarily preventative care. So, if you target keyword phrases centered around pests like Japanese Beetles or some pest that comes in a frenzy, you may get your foot in the door. 
Just make sure your sales team knows how to find all of those additional problems on their property they’re likely unaware of. That’s how you sell a comprehensive, proactive plan!
Social isn't just for political rants; it’s for making your brand buzzworthy and being seen as a helpful expert as it relates to tree care.
And if you’re doing a great job at producing valuable content on a regular basis, you’ll have a lot of great articles, videos, etc. to share on your social media channels.
regularly posts helpful blog articles to their social media channels.
Personally, I don’t think paying for social media is a worthwhile investment for tree care. The cost per lead is often very high and users are not often in a position of searching for this service when mindlessly scrolling through their feed. Just use your platforms to educate and raise awareness.
Whether your sole gig is tree care or you’re a lawn care company adding tree and shrub services, your brand should have the heart of a teacher. 
Just have realistic expectations when it comes to . Remember, your customers often don’t care until it’s too late. Tease them with knowledge. 
Don’t ramble on in your email newsletter with 150 words about Phytophthora on the Colorado Blue Spruce. Just feature 15-20 words about 3 different issues going on right now. Then have a button and links in your email to drive them to more written content and videos that you created. 
Recipients may not open every email. They may not click on links. But they’ll remember you’re a helpful expert when they start to raise an eyebrow at that browning bunch of needles down the line.
Every tip I’ve given you so far is going to be for naught if your sales team isn’t doing the following things. 
  * Whether it’s responding to an inbound lead or just a “quality check” on an account, you know your arborists can find other compelling examples of why your prospective plant health care customer needs a program. I used to love doing the ol’ “bug-in-a-bag” trick. Go take 4-5 clippings of problems around the property. Leave a note (or even better, include a proposal) and it’s hard to ignore the present problems. Heck, you could even send them a 1-1 video.


[RELATED VIDEO SERIES: ]
  * Have a ton of customers and not sure who would be the most interested? Create some calling campaigns based on interest. If you send out an email (and have a good email marketing tool), call the people who opened and clicked the links first. Just tell them you’re touching base to see how things are going and then casually offer up a free inspection. Likewise, you can let them know you’re reaching out to clients about a present issue you’re seeing a lot of in the area. 
  * One of the biggest wastes of marketing dollars comes from poor follow-up on leads. You have to call every inbound inquiry at least 3 times, email them, send a carrier pigeon, whatever! Don’t call one time and then abandon the opportunity. Likewise, don’t give up on outstanding proposals. People get busy and then lose interest. Keep emailing and calling them. They’ll probably have questions about your proposal and then you can impress the urgency of getting the right tree and shrub treatments done at the right time (like NOW dude!). 


Selling the invisible isn't a Houdini act; it’s about making the invisible seen, felt, and most importantly, valued. Plant health care is not just a service—it's a mentality change that begins in your target client’s mind.
Alright, here's the big reveal—like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but better. You've got the knowledge, the tips, the tricks, and even the emotional and intellectual appeals to get your clients not just nodding but reaching for their wallets. But all this is just pre-show buzz until you make your move. 
Start implementing these tree and shrub care marketing tips and you’ll start seeing more plant health care leads on a consistent basis.

# My 7 Favorite Ways to Use Photos on Lawn Care or Landscaping Websites
The best lawn care or landscaping websites are packed with beautiful photos. Thick, green grass. Masterfully-designed outdoor living areas. Pristinely manicured commercial properties. And even though that’s what you sell, don’t forget about the people. The clients, designers, account managers, and hard-working crews and support staff that make this all possible. If you’re like the many busy business owners I talk to, getting more pro-quality photos may have been on the back burner longer than you’d like. Or maybe you have a ton of great visual assets. But for some reason, they’re not easily found on your website. If you’d like to create a captivating lawn care or landscaping website packed with images, check out these tips. And, I’ll be sure to share lots of great examples for you. 
Heroes don't always wear capes. On the best lawn care and landscaping websites, they're the first visuals that greet visitors on a page. 
_In the example above, we planned a professional photo shoot with some of ' clients. You may sell lawn care services, but these moments are really what clients buy!_
Full-width in all their glory, these images set the tone and expectation about the page’s content. But most importantly, they can deeply connect with the website visitor. Just imagine showcasing a family on a perfectly manicured lawn. Feel the cool breeze under the trees as you take your lunch at that corporate office complex. 
_For the website, we captured stunning professional images of the beautiful properties they service. These wide shots are a great backdrop for minimal text._
Pow! First impression made. I often recommend using the real hero (your clients) in these images. People love to see authentic images of customers’ lives you have improved.
As you scroll down from the full-width hero image, the written content starts to explain more. These split modules are the Ying-Yangs of website design. Perfect balance. Half text, half image. 
_Below is how we broke up images and text on the desktop version of the website. Notice how the image helps visitors to digest small sections of text with a visual illustration._
On desktop computers, they sit side by side, with each image complementing its textual counterpart. You can even alternate the position of the images as you break up text sections into delicious bite-sized morsels. Mobile users? The split image layout stacks, offering a seamless flow between imagery and info.
_Below is how this page responds on a mobile device._
These little clickables (often with snappy images) guide your visitor deeper into the rabbit hole of your services or other info. Pique their interest with a visual snippet of what’s to come, like a team member performing a specific service.
Watch the video below to see how you can use images as quick links to other pages. I love how we were able to repeat the shape of the logo in these image cards. 
Who said landscaping and lawn care businesses can't be artsy? Tease your visitors with a splash of your best work: a beautiful blend of 4-6 images, subtly nudging them to explore more. 
_Watch the video below to see how these image collages really helped us to create some visual interest on the website._
Throw in a nearby button to “See More Images” and guide them to my next idea.
Let’s get interactive! If you’re still stuck with those archaic individual galleries, it’s time for an upgrade. Think filters. Consumers are used to going to a website and being able to quickly sort products to see exactly what they want.
Dynamic image galleries allow the aspiring grillmaster to select and see only the pics of the regal outdoor kitchens you’ve created.Or showcase your mastery over a specific commercial property type like an HOA. Dynamic galleries make it a breeze.
_Watch the video below to see how the Dynamic Image gallery on the website allows property managers to sort through their library to see images of a certain property type._
Words are powerful, but a picture alongside a testimonial? That's dynamite! The next time Mr. Jones raves about your impeccable service, why not showcase that majestic oak you pruned to perfection right beside his gleaming words? Or even better, get a picture of him!
_Below is an example of how we featured client testimonials on the website._
When a property manager participates in a case study article, put their beautiful smile right by their name, along with images of your team working on-site.
_Below is an example of one of the many case studies we've created for . Adding a headshot of the client helps to add a lot of authenticity to this article!_
For those landscaping and lawn care maestros aiming to educate (that should be all of you!), don't just tell; show! 
Watch the video below to see how images add visual interest to the blog and can create a more immersive experience for the reader.
Whether you're discussing a common lawn ailment or the newest landscaping trend, vivid visuals can cement your points, making readers linger and—hopefully—fill out a web form! Google often ranks website pages with a longer “dwell time”. Adding images to articles is a great way to go from an average 1-minute skip-and-bounce to a 7-minute educational feast.
People love great images. They give a quick and powerful representation of your brand and help curious consumers become ideal clients. In the grand theater of lawn care and landscaping, your website is your stage. Don’t just be another face in the crowd with cheesy stock photos or those sad DIY attempts. Be the star. Invest in professional photography, and remember: it's not just about having the snaps; it's about how and where you flaunt them.If you’d like more lawn care or landscaping website tips like these, .

# The Perfect "About" Page: 8 Essentials for Landscaping & Lawn Care Websites
Potential customers often think lawn care and landscaping companies are all the same. And when they read “About” pages on their websites, they’re even more confused.…and unimpressed.
About pages on green industry websites are frequently mediocre at best. 
They use corporate lingo. They often don’t show the people who lead or work at the company. They’re uninspiring and ineffective. 
Creating an About page that resonates with prospects and potential team members is both an art and a science. can showcase your company's personality, values, and unique selling points, if you take the right steps. 
Today, I’m going to give some insights and examples regarding About pages that wow website visitors. Take these tips to heart and you could become the brand everyone wants to do business with (or the company they’d love to work at).
In today's fast-paced digital world, attention spans are short. Break up your content into digestible chunks. 
Use concise paragraphs, high-quality images, and engaging videos to make your page scannable and appealing. When we design lawn care and landscaping websites, we call these bite-sized morsels of content, “flexible modules” we can fashion however we see fit.
This approach ensures visitors can quickly find the information they seek without feeling overwhelmed. Each content module could have an opportunity to click a button and dive into a page with more specific information about that topic. 
First impressions matter. Start with a compelling “hero” image featuring your team—think smiles, camaraderie, and a glimpse into your company culture. 
This is not an opportunity to show off your full fleet of vehicles. (Honestly…your customers don’t care.) Vehicles can be a prop but not the focus.
Pair this “hero image” at the top of your About page with a headline and optional subheadline that immediately convey who you are and what you stand for. An engaging introduction sets the stage for the story you're about to tell.
Every company has a story—share yours. Discuss your origins, challenges overcome, and milestones achieved. 
However, authentic and impactful storytelling creates an emotional connection with your audience, making your brand memorable. Avoid corporate jargon. Instead, use a conversational tone that reflects your company's personality.
And whenever possible, tell your story through the lens of your customers. Even though your About page should be mostly about you, don’t forget that the people reading this are the center of their own story, whether they’re looking to hire you or work at your organization. 
[RELATED READING: [See How Easily You Can Use These 5 Elements of Storytelling to Sell More Work](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/5-elements-of-storytelling)]
Ah, the important but often meaningless core values. They frequently communicate the same things in practically verbatim terms.
Of course, we all want to be known for integrity. Obviously, we’re committed to quality. Yes, companies thrive when they embrace teamwork. 
Use interesting words to convey the same concepts. This will engage the reader and not make them skim and roll their eyes. Here’s an example of how we do this at Landscape Leadership® with our core values:
  * Count on each other: We embrace our accountability towards one another.
  * Get it done right: A job well done starts with approaching priorities with a proactive mindset.
  * Work and play: Our work is more meaningful when we take care of ourselves.
  * Celebrate wins big and small: When we do good work, we acknowledge it.
  * Achieve impact and profits: Our clients’ success leads to our financial success.


Your core values are the heartbeat of your company. Instead of generic statements, delve into what truly sets you apart by creatively stating it differently. Then provide more explanation. But whatever you do, keep it concise and visual. People will skim these. 
I’m dumbfounded by how often I visit an About page and do not see a single team member’s picture. Or if I do see a picture, it may be a 20-year-old shot of the owner and no one else. 
People don’t hire companies. They hire people. And people’s careers aren’t based on organizations. The people they work with make or break them. 
Most green industry companies are missing a huge opportunity for connection. Your entire website, specifically your About page, should be packed full of professional visuals. Whether photos or videos, they should feature smiling people who clearly love what they do. 
Beyond fun group pictures, be sure to feature key leadership, salespeople, and customer service reps. If you have a small company, feature your entire team. 
You may even want to create short bios for each team member. If a visitor clicks their name, it can open a box that highlights their expertise, passions, and a few personal details. This can create a deeper unique identity for your company. 
Bonus tip, you could even write in-depth articles about some team members’ career journeys and personal lives. Extra bonus tips if you also create a video version!

## 5. Stand Out With a Unique Selling Proposition & Testimonials
What makes you stand out in a sea of competitors? Clearly articulate your unique selling proposition (USP). You can do this in a “How We’re Different” section or weave it throughout the rest of your content. 
Just beware of using hyperbole. Try to avoid claims that all of your competitors make. Words like “unparalleled”, “reliable”, and “high-quality” are meaningless to visitors. These are bare minimum expectations and your competitors are not a proponent of the opposite. 
If you’re going to prove you are truly unique, you better be able to say something most of your competitors cannot. And instead of making empty claims, use customer testimonials throughout your content. No one says it better than a raving fan.
When you feature customer testimonials, link to a page that shares more of them. 
You’d also be shocked to know how many times I go to landscaping and lawn care websites and have to hunt for where they actually perform services. Yet service areas are a big part of your company’s positioning. Call this out in a section and you can link to a page that goes into more detail. 
Be sure to also showcase your involvement in local events, charities, or initiatives. This not only establishes your presence but also demonstrates your commitment to the community. A bulleted list of organizations you support can effectively convey this information. If you have more info to share, create a link to a page that shares more details. 
There is an epidemic in the green industry. Brands are hitting their audience over their heads with awards, certifications, and associations.
These elements are important but think of them as salt in a recipe. Sprinkle them into content but have a link to a page that explains more. 
Great future team members will likely check out your website. People want to work for winners and your About page on your lawn care or landscaping website can help them discover how you fit into their career journey.
Just remember that your About page doesn’t also need to be your website’s career center. Create a small module on careers and link out to more information elsewhere. 
Your "About" page isn't just a section on your website; it's a powerful tool to connect with both potential clients and future team members. But it’s not going to automatically happen without thinking it through thoroughly. 
It’s going to take a new perspective and challenging the norms you see on lawn care and landscaping websites. You also would be wise to look outside of the green industry for some fresh ideas. 
You’ve got a great, unique story to tell about what your organization is all about. Go for it. 
If you’d like to create a landscaping or lawn care website packed full of fresh ideas and lasting impressions, . We regularly share tips just like these. And if you need help pulling your website and your entire marketing strategy together in a more compelling way, contact us to .

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/sell-more-landscape-design-build-using-videos

If you’d like your landscape company to not be seen as Just Another Landscaper, using video during your sales process is a great way to stand out. Not only can video improve the experience for everyone involved, but it can also help you sell more landscape design-build projects.
You’re probably sick of dealing with prospects who get multiple bids and lose interest along the way. And, I think you’re likely fed up with wasting time and missing out on better opportunities.
There are plenty of industries already implementing video into their sales process. In the landscape industry, it’s becoming more common to see videos used for marketing and recruiting.But rarely for selling.For the past 20+ years of my experience in the green industry, I have spent half of that selling landscaping. I’ve also worked alongside landscape designers and companies that have sold millions of dollars of projects. Some of these ideas may stretch you but hang with me. I’m going to highlight opportunities where you can incorporate video into your landscape design-build sales process. I’ve also used many of these tactics myself. You likely won’t incorporate all of these ideas at once. In fact, I think that would be biting off more than you can chew. Implement these in stages.
I’m going to outline these ideas with some level of explanation, along with some additional resources for you. Please note that these appear in chronological order as it relates to a typical landscape design-build sales process. You don’t have to start implementing them in this order.
In a , I talked about how to use personalized 1-to-1 sales videos to sell more landscaping. After you get a landscaping design-build lead, you can send your prospect a brief 1-to-1 introduction video.
The primary goal of this video is to humanize your landscaping company. Your second goal is to set up the next step, a brief discussion to further pre-qualify your landscape design-build lead. This 1-to-1 video can be sent via email or SMS message. I would also recommend using a tool like to create a convenient link to the available times on your calendar. In this one-minute 1-1 video, introduce yourself, reference their project details, and tell them the next step is to click an additional link to schedule a time for a “Project Discussion Call”.

There are other times during the sales process when you can send more 1:1 videos. When you’ve completed your landscape design, send your prospect another email or SMS message with a one-minute 1-to-1 video. Enthusiastically explain that you have their landscape design ready and instruct them to use the calendar link in your email to schedule a meeting.
Your landscaping company should be having a pre-qualification phone call at a minimum. I would present this to a prospect as a “Project Discussion Call”. Alternatively, you could use a video meeting instead. Video meetings have become a way of life, post-pandemic. In addition to deepening your connection, your pre-qualification video meeting should follow a specific outline to qualify your prospect. In 15-20 minutes, qualify your landscape design-build prospect for Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline, and your company’s Positioning.

When you’ve agreed there is a mutual fit, schedule an on-site consultation while on this call. You may want to . If so, you could collect payment on this prequalification call.
[RELATED READING: [When, Why, & How to Charge a Landscape Consultation Fee](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/when-why-how-to-charge-landscape-consultation-fee)]
Then tell them how to prepare for the on-site consultation.
At this point, you’ve had a valuable discussion and are building rapport with your prospect. At the end of your pre-qualification video meeting, I would recommend saying the following:
_“Okay, I’m glad we’ve determined there’s a mutual fit here. Before I come out for your on-site consultation on (date), I will have some homework on my end so we can have a productive conversation.__I’m going to send you an email in a few minutes. I have two short videos I’d like you to watch before we meet. It shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes. Can you agree to do that?”_
You’ve qualified for BANT+P but your prospective client is not just along for the ride. It’s time for them to confirm they’re serious. Send them two professionally-produced videos, one about your design-build process, and the second video should be a video case study on a past project.

[RELATED READING: [10 Cool Things HubSpot’s Sales Software Can Do for Your Landscape Sales Team - With Video Demos](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/hubspot-sales-software-crm-for-landscapers)]
I am not suggesting that you cancel your on-site consultation if they don’t view the videos. Most prospects will, and they’ll be better informed and will be more impressed with your client's success story.
If you are incorporating video into your landscape design-build sales process, you’re going to stand out. Most of your competitors aren’t doing this. Your landscape company will transition from a brand to a friendly personality. These video steps will help you to sell more landscape design-build and stop wasting time as an unpaid consultant. Your prospective clients will be more engaged, informed, and invested. This is work. It requires change. Implement one of these ideas at a time and learn to do them well. Pay money to hire a professional when it makes sense. They should be able to help you develop a strategy and provide creative direction for your DIY 1-to-1 videos and video meeting formats. They can also do the best job at producing case studies and topical videos to wow your prospects.

# How to Protect Your Position as the Leader in Your Market (5 Strategies)
I want to tell you a story about a landscaping company that no longer exists.A short time before their demise they were regarded as the most creative and successful design/build company in their local market. They were one of the three largest as measured by annual revenue. They were company to work with and work for.. Unfortunately, I was there to see it come to an abrupt end when it was sold for peanuts and absorbed into another local landscaping company.It didn't have to happen that way.
This was a firmly established market leader with a twenty-year pedigree. They had market share and share of mind.Let's define these two terms before moving on with our story.Market share represents the percentage of an industry, or a market's total sales, that is earned by a particular company over a specified time period. Market share is calculated by taking the company's sales over the period and dividing it by the total sales of the industry over the same period.If total lawn care sales in the Minneapolis market was $200 million in one year and your lawn care sales were $10 million in that same time frame you would have a 5% market share.Mindshare - or share of mind - is a term that describes the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product, idea, or company. It is the consumer perception of a particular brand compared to their rivals. This is much more difficult to quantify compared to market share, though still very important.This company had top revenues and the top rung of the ladder in the mind of their prospects.So what happened?Both the company's market share and share of mind were eroded over a number of years as, simultaneously, key employees left to join competitors or start their own companies in the same market, and, the company changed ownership three times.That's a lot of turmoil, but, not so much that it should have buried the company.**The real problem was that this once-strong landscaping business got complacent and did absolutely nothing to protect their leadership position in the market as operations were becoming unhinged**.They had a giant target on their chest, and instead of fighting back, they sat in their corner and took all the best punches from their competitors (many of whom had once worked at the company!).I watched all this happen. I heard customers calling to complain and cancel maintenance contracts. I heard past employees disparaging the company and taking clients. I saw the leads dry up.It was brutal.
The company-wide ego clouded the reality of the situation. They thought once at the top of the mountain, always at the top. Wrong-o!As a leader in your marketplace there are numerous things you need to do to maintain your position. Recruiting, culture, quality of service, pricing strategy... all of these things are important. However, in this article, I'm going to focus strictly on what you can do from a marketing perspective.Marketing – or lack thereof – is exactly where this company dropped the ball. They did absolutely nothing as it relates to marketing. As I've described, they thought they could survive on reputation alone.IMPORTANT: How you market your business as the leader in your marketplace should be very different compared to how you promoted your services when you started your company and were chasing the top companies.**You need to shift your marketing strategy for the present reality** , not stop marketing all together like this company I've described.When I think about this "shift", I put the various marketing strategies and tactics into five big buckets:1. Polish your brand2. Advertise your leadership position3. Stay involved in your community4. Promote your industry5. Promote your thought leadershipAs you can probably see, **maintaining your leadership position in your market comes down to elevating your visibility**.Let's go in-depth into each of these...
You know what it takes to protect your leadership position? Now is the time to spend that profit, not hoard it for your exit.If your visual brand identity (i.e.- logo and other assets) is a bit outdated, then now is the time to refresh it.Wrap those vehicles. And do it in a way that screams, "" (i.e.- not cheap asses) and elicits a heavy sigh of disdain from your competitors.How you present your company online – namely your website – should reflect your position in the marketplace. In other words, you should have the best damn website in your market. After all, isn't that what your customers and prospects expect from the leader??I can say the same about your visual assets like photography and video. **Spend the money to keep your competitors a step or two behind**. If not now, then when? After your competitors knock you off the mountain top? Then you'll open your wallet?? That'll be too late.
Starbucks spent less than $10 million on advertising in its first ten years. They relied on publicity and word of mouth to grow their brand. Wal-mart, Microsoft, and Google did the same. Only recently have you seen paid advertising from Amazon on your television.There's a reason for that... and a lesson for you.Today, all of these companies advertise. But, they don't advertise to build their brand, they advertise to defend their brand from competition and to maintain their leadership position in the minds of consumers.**[Advertising should always come after you have achieved a strong position in your market](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/bid/173965/the-10-rules-of-advertising-what-every-landscaping-company-should-know-about-advertising). Not before**.ABC Home and Commercial Services is a do-it-all kind of landscaping company here in Austin, Texas. They may be the largest company, as measured by total revenue, in Central Texas. They advertise regularly on television, radio, and billboards throughout Austin.They spend considerable advertising dollars to defend and protect their leadership position.Speaking of spending...Throw out the idea of return on investment (ROI) as it relates to paid advertising channels like television, radio, and print. Starbucks and Amazon don't spend millions of dollars on advertising to grow their brand and capture more market share.Remember, they spend those millions to protect their brand. They don't expect a return on their investment in the traditional sense.As the leader in your local marketplace, this should be your mentality too. If contemplating a radio advertising campaign for $20,000, the primary question should not be, "hmm, well, are we going to sell $80,000 worth of work to pay for this campaign?"The question to ask is whether or not your ads are going to reach the right audience first of all. Assuming this to be the case, then your strategy should be to promote and reinforce your leadership position in the mind of consumers.Side note: Direct response advertising, like post cards, is completely different. You should absolutely consider ROI with a direct response advertising campaign.Back to the company I worked for who eventually went under...As I'm sure you can guess, they didn't spend a dime on advertising. Their mentality was, "Why would we spend money on advertising when everyone already knows who we are?"I guess they thought they were smarter than Starbucks and Amazon.
When this company was quietly acquired and had to move its longtime office and three acres of plant inventory and hard goods over the course of a summer, they didn't even bother to put a sign in front of the property telling onlookers what was happening. Unsurprisingly, the word around town and throughout the industry was that the company was going out of business. But that wasn't the case at the time.Can you imagine a scenario like this? Such complacency that even a sign was too much of a bother!Don't be like this, please.Leaders don't hide away in a basement. They are front and center.Sponsor events and causes in your local community.In May 2020, [ABC Home & Commercial Services pledged to donate a portion of its sales to local food banks](https://www.pctonline.com/article/abc-home-commercial-services-community-outreach-donations-food-banks-give-back/) through June, 2020, resulting in $82,380 in donations, which provided nearly 330,000 meals across Texas.Leverage your leadership position in the community for media opportunities and free publicity. Bobby Jenkins, owner of ABC, about their involvement in the annual KVUE 5 Who Care Awards in which they are a lead sponsor..
The lawn and landscaping industry is not a zero-sum game. There's no consumer spending cap. Because of this your company's growth strategy should include promoting and growing the entire market for your services while protecting and maintaining your position as the leader.Would you rather have 6% market share in a $200 million marketplace or 5% in a $300 million marketplace? Do the math. It's the ole' "grow the pie" metaphor in action. See the illustration above."Growing the pie" requires innovation and leadership on your part as the market leader, not stagnation and complacency.This is one reason I appreciate professionals like , , and who understand what it means to grow the pie and don't shy away from a leadership position in promoting the lawn and landscaping industry as a whole. It helps their companies... and everyone else. Participate in your state and local industry associations. Take a leadership role to spur innovation in others.Showing up and being visible within your industry helps protect your position as the market leader.
There was so much turnover in ownership and key employees at this doomed company that all credibility, authority, and thought leadership slowly drained away. There was no leader or figurehead. It's impossible for a company to maintain market leadership without this.. This is where , whether that's through writing, video, or even podcasting. YOU, the owner or executive, should be front and center in this initiative.This can include speaking at local or industry events if you are comfortable in that role. You are a recognized leader. Your peers and prospects want to hear your insight.This strategy supports the previous two points I made: Stay involved in your community and promote your industry.
At the time, the fall of this company I was working for seemed very dramatic. But, in hindsight, it was a slow progression rather than a sudden push off a cliff. Their market share decreased little by little while slowly moving down the ladder of consumer awareness until they were merely an afterthought, rather than the leader like they once were.This story should serve as a cautionary tale for any of you who currently find yourselves as one of the leading companies in your marketplace. This fall can happen to any company.You must be proactive and purposeful in protecting your leadership position.

# Social Media Hack: Why HubSpot is Perfect for Lawn Care & Landscaping
Social media is a powerful tool for enhancing your lawn and landscaping brand. But let’s be real: consistently posting high-quality content is challenging. 
Maybe you had a team meeting to brainstorm ideas and offered pizza to crew members who shared or “liked” your posts. But when the busy season rolled in, social media management was the first thing you ignored.
Suddenly, no one can remember the logins, there’s confusion over who’s in charge, and no one is carving out time to post new content.
Today, we’re going to share how to leverage the power of HubSpot. This integrated platform not only hosts a website but can unite visual media and the content you curate. The result is a powerful but easy-to-use tool to boost your efficiency and results on social media. 
Digging through files to find the perfect photo or video can be a frustrating experience especially when you have to do it each time you want to create a post. 
The HubSpot platform offers various hubs to improve your marketing and sales efforts. Some of the hubs we’ll be talking about in this article are:
  * HubSpot Content Hub: Hosts your website and allows for easy creation of website pages and more. This also comes with a file manager to store images and videos.
  * HubSpot Marketing Pro: This tier of marketing hub includes robust social media tools that connect seamlessly with the content hub.
  * HubSpot Mobile App: A free solution that allows users to use many of their subscribed features.


With the Hubspot mobile app, your crew can take pictures out in the field and upload them directly from their phone’s camera roll into the content library for anyone to use.
When using the web interface of HubSpot’s social tools, you can also easily create and manage your social media strategy. 
One of the most significant advantages of HubSpot is the ability to manage multiple social accounts including:


No more juggling multiple logins or wasting time logging in and out of different platforms. HubSpot lets you connect up to 50 accounts.
You can post the same content across channels with ease, saving time and maintaining consistency in your messaging. 
[6 Time-Saving Social Media Tips for Lawn Care Companies and Landscapers](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/6-time-saving-social-media-tips-for-lawn-care-companies-and-landscapers)]
Time management is key in the lawn care and landscaping business. HubSpot allows you to schedule posts ahead of time, enabling you to plan your content during the off-season when things are quieter. 
Instead of spending time each day posting, you can block off an hour or two and schedule posts for a few months in advance. And with HubSpot’s recommendations for optimal posting times, you’ll maximize your content’s visibility.
This proactive approach means you can keep your social media channels active even when your team is busy delighting customers.
With blog auto-publishing, you can even automatically publish social posts as new blog posts are published. These social posts include the blog post title, link, and a featured image. Facebook and X posts also include the blog post's meta description.
Getting team buy-in for social media sharing can sometimes feel like pulling teeth. HubSpot simplifies this by allowing your team members to link their personal Facebook and LinkedIn accounts to your company’s social media. 
That way when you schedule posts to go live on your company page, they will post at the same on your sales team's individual profiles enhancing your reach and creating a unified voice across platforms. 
Understanding the impact of your social media efforts is crucial for long-term success. HubSpot provides comprehensive reporting tools that track engagement across all your social platforms over time.
This valuable data can guide your strategy and help you adjust your approach, ensuring your social media efforts align with your overall branding objectives.
HubSpot also has a social media monitoring tool to notify you of likes, shares, and comments on your posts as well as mentions. This monitoring tool tracks everything in one place, so you never miss the opportunity to engage with your audience. 
Let’s face it: in the landscaping industry, things can get hectic. If you don’t have a streamlined process in place, it’s easy to let your social media slip when your schedule gets packed. 
Hubspot isn't just a standalone social tool but can integrate your website, content library, marketing initiatives, and even sales functions.
. We'll send you new articles right to your inbox. If you're ready for a comprehensive marketing strategy including helpful social media tools like this,

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/trademarks-safeguard-your-green-industry-brand

Imagine this nightmare scenario...You've built a thriving lawn care or landscaping business over the past 15 years. Your company name is on everything—trucks, uniforms, business cards, your website, and even your ads. Clients recognize it, trust it, and it’s become your most valuable asset. Then one day, you get a cease-and-desist letter. If you continue to use your brand name, you're getting sued big time. It turns out that a bigger company—maybe even one from out of state—holds the trademark for the name you’ve been using all these years. And now, they’re demanding that you stop using it immediately.
And it doesn't stop there. You also have to pay them damages and here's the kicker...you also have to pay attorney fees.What do you do? You can either: 
  * Fight them in court, which can be expensive and time-consuming with no guarantee of success. 
  * Rebrand everything, which means overhauling your website, rewrapping your trucks, redoing signs, printing new materials, editing videos and photos, and the list goes on forever. This is not just costly but also a branding setback. 


This isn’t a hypothetical scenario. That’s exactly what happened to one of our clients, and it was a major challenge for their business. 
If you own a landscaping or lawn care business, you might think, _“I’m just a local company. Do I really need a trademark?”_
I sat down with , an intellectual property (IP) attorney with , to talk about why trademarks matter in the green industry and how business owners can protect themselves from costly legal battles. 
A trademark is any element that makes your brand unique in the eyes of customers. According to Richard, that includes: 
  * Colors & Packaging: If your brand has a signature look.
  * Sounds: Unique jingles or sound bites that identify your brand. 


Generic Terms: Words that describe what you do, like “Lawn Care” or “Tree Trimming.” 
  * Common Industry Phrases: If many companies use a term, you probably won’t get exclusive rights to it. 
  * Your Last Name Alone: Unless it has developed strong recognition (e.g., “Ford” in the auto industry). 


The key is that your trademark should be distinctive, not just descriptive of your services. 
Our client, , wisely trademarked their name as well as their logo. As they expand into new markets, this will help to protect their brand from competitors.
Many landscaping and lawn care business owners assume that simply using their name in business gives them ownership. Technically, they do gain common law rights, but these are very limited. 
  * Common law rights may only apply to your geographic area. If a competitor trademarks your name in another state, they could block you from expanding.
  * Common law trademarks are harder to enforce legally, meaning you may lose a fight against a company with a federally registered trademark. 


According to Richard, federal trademark registration provides significantly stronger protection by: 
  * Strengthening your legal position if someone tries to use a similar name.
  * Allowing you to block competitors from using confusingly similar branding.


Without a trademark, your business is exposed to several risks: 
A bigger competitor could trademark your name and force you to stop using it.
Rebranding is expensive. Updating signs, truck wraps, uniforms, websites, and marketing materials can be a major financial burden. 
Legal battles are costly. Losing a trademark dispute could mean paying damages, legal fees, and even the other company’s attorney costs. Large companies often don’t notice smaller businesses at first. But the moment you start growing—whether through a big marketing campaign or expansion—they will. That’s when legal action becomes a real possibility. 
##  Smart business owners like our client, Chase Coates from have gotten professional help to file their trademarks.
If you’re thinking, _“I need to do this, but I have no idea where to start,”_ here’s what Richard recommends: 
Before registering a trademark, you need to ensure no one else has already claimed it. 
Cost Estimate: Around $550+ for a professional search by an IP attorney. A simple Google search is not enough. A professional trademark search reviews federal, state, and industry-specific databases to uncover potential conflicts.
Once you confirm your brand name is available, you can apply for federal trademark registration. 
Cost Estimate: Around $3,500+ for filing in one category (includes government fees and legal support). 
The process typically takes about a year and involves multiple steps, including: 
  * Application review by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).
  * Responses to potential objections from the government or third parties. 


About 85% of trademark applications receive some form of rejection initially, but an experienced attorney can help navigate the process and address issues. 
## Protect Your Landscaping or Lawn Care Brand Before It’s Too Late 
If you own a landscaping or lawn care company, your brand is one of your most valuable assets. Protecting it now can save you from major financial and legal headaches in the future. 
_71% of my LinkedIn connections are still at risk! Get your trademark ASAP!_
If you want to avoid a costly rebrand or legal battle, take action now.

## Page: https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/what-happens-stop-blogging-green-industry-case-study

You're gaining ground, even passing your green industry competitors. You've created hundreds of insightful blog articles. They're ranking well in search results. They're bringing in traffic and leads for your lawn care or landscaping company. 
It begs the question, "Can we let our foot off of the gas?" When is enough blog content enough? Do we need to continue blogging?
Today, I have 3 real-life examples to share. I'll show you what happens when you A) stay consistent with B) stop completely, and C) get started again later. 
Here's what will happen if you create thoughtful content over a period of years. This lawn care company went all-in back in 2018. Together, we've been creating new articles each month for six years. 
They've been crushing it when it comes to organic traffic. Creating quality articles to answer people's questions in an in-depth manner is driving steady growth. Likewise, we've also witnessed that:


Clear signs of success. That green monster of organic traffic is helping this client win. 
This next example is from a past client. We rebuilt their website in mid-2016 and it launched that fall.
Over the next 3 years, we published approximately 4 monthly articles and a few longer content resources.
In the fall of 2019, they told us they wanted to try other tactics and invest less in their marketing efforts. 
Turns out blogging was no longer a priority (we've been watching for new articles and the blog has gone radio silent).
The graph above shows a typical "sleep, creep, leap" trend for green industry content marketing. 2017, 2018, and 2019's articles made their traffic explode. Another thing we're particularly proud of is how this content continues to bring in future traffic and leads.
As the challenging times of 2020 and 2021 unfolded, their website's content kept generating quality traffic. 
But that doesn't last forever. You can see that 3 years later and their traffic is gradually declining. 
Ignoring content marketing for your green industry company comes with a cost. So what happens if you fire the ol' blog machine back up?

Time to be honest and vulnerable. We broke our own rules.
When founder, , first started Landscape Leadership® back in 2008, he was a content marketing pioneer in the green industry. 
He faithfully created content for 10 years. , I pitched in as well. We both love writing and educating our industry peers. We consistently published 2-3 articles a month. 
Then life got busy. You know the story. Change the characters but the plot is the same. 
From 2020 through 2022, we sporadically created new content. In 2023, I dug my heels in and recommitted. I even had our team write some content from time to time. 
But this big ol' beast of a machine takes a long time to build momentum. We're growing and doing great work while publishing 2 new articles per month. 
Overall, I'm happy with the gradual improvement I'm seeing with our traffic. I'm committed to the process and want to ramp up our efforts in the next year (3rd article this month for the win).
We're breaking sales records and always seem to have a good pipeline. The momentum is growing. The 5,000+ blog subscribers are becoming more active as we've increased consistency. Our socials are full of great content and interaction. 
A lot can go wrong in a race. You may lose your lead in the flash of an eye. You need to gain every bit of a lead as you can on competitors.
New articles are only part of winning the content marketing race.
I recommend aiming for at least 1-2 quality pieces of new content each month when you get to this advanced stage of creating hundreds of articles. And focus on quality not quantity.
Double down on optimizing your old content. Not every article will be a home run. You may need to re-optimize old posts, changing the title, headings, and keywords used. You may want to add more content to expand sections. 
You may even want to rewrite some articles, depending on the topic. You won't have the rapid changes we see in the marketing industry. But some green industry topics you've addressed in the past deserve a fresh take. 
Google wants to see you creating content. They don't like irrelevant, quiet brands. 
Stomp on the gas and win. Leave your competitors in the dust. 
If you like insights like these, consider like 5,000+ of your green industry peers. You'll get new articles sent directly to your inbox. If you're ready for a comprehensive strategy including consistent blog content, with us.

# What it Takes to Get More Commercial Landscaping Contracts (& Fewer Residential)
Have you ever had this thought? “I’m so done with residential clients. If I could get more commercial landscaping contracts, I’d just walk away from this part of the business!”
So what’s holding you back? Maybe this is the right direction for your landscaping business to take. There’s no right or wrong when it comes to choosing a lane of B2C or B2B. But it’s a great consideration that could lead to a healthier organization.
In the ever-evolving world of landscaping, making the decision to transition from primarily serving residential clients to commercial properties can be intimidating. However, if executed correctly, this shift can result in significant business growth and specialization. As seen in the below, you can see that 61% of landscape companies have realized that picking a lane of either B2C or B2B is the best choice for their companies. 
Landscape Leadership has supported numerous businesses through this pivotal transition. Drawing on our expertise, we’re offering insights on how to successfully reposition and maximize your marketing strategies to get more commercial landscape contracts and allow someone else to deal with Mr. Homeowner.
Your company's focus defines its trajectory. Often, businesses are tempted to juggle both residential and commercial markets. However, based on our observations of companies ranging from $5 million to $300 million in revenue, it's evident that those that grow the most quickly are those with a clear and undivided focus.
Why is this so crucial? Think about a brand's identity. It's challenging to project proficiency in both residential and commercial landscaping simultaneously. Consumers often perceive a trade-off: a company that's creative enough for residential may not be production-focused enough for large-scale commercial projects.
A culture of creativity is focused on maximizing innovation (and profitability within that context). Creativity is not compatible with production because innovation is highly inefficient.
An examination of the top 20 U.S. landscaping companies will reveal a significant trend: the giants often focus exclusively on commercial accounts. While revenue isn’t the complete picture, it appears these landscaping industry leaders have made a decision and stuck with it.
[RELATED READING: [The Challenges You Face Serving Residential & Commercial Markets - Part 1 - The Culture Clash](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/challenges-residential-versus-commercial-markets-part-1)]
If you wish to get more commercial landscaping contracts, your branding should leave no room for doubt. Commercial property managers need to be convinced of your proficiency, and this begins with your brand presentation. Here are some tips to achieve this:
Prioritize showcasing commercial projects on your website, in marketing materials, and across social media. This may mean investing heavily in professional photography and videos for multiple years to capture enough visuals of the commercial contracts you currently service. Plan on continuing that investment over the next several years so you can share a wide assortment of commercially-focused visuals.
_Below is one of the many videos we created for_ _to focus on specific target accounts. These videos can be fine-tuned for Community Associations, Public Sector, and any commercial property type._
Whether it's website content, blog posts, social media updates, or email campaigns, your content should discuss issues relevant to commercial property managers. This not only demonstrates expertise but also establishes trust. In order to do this effectively, it may mean rewriting most, if not all, of your website content to specifically and exclusively address commercial property managers. 
_Below is an example of one of the many helpful articles on the_ _blog. These topics are geared specifically to commercial property managers._
A picture speaks a thousand words, but a video can narrate the entire story. Use visual media to highlight past commercial projects, emphasizing challenges faced and solutions provided. Property managers often pay attention to nearby or competing properties. They often want to have the premier property but with a hassle-free customer experience. Hiring a video production company to help tell these stories can help establish your credibility in the B2B sector.
_Below is an example of one of the many video case studies on_ _’s website. They exclusively serve commercial clients and these stories are very compelling!_
[RELATED READING: ]
Transitioning doesn’t mean severing ties with residential clients overnight. Instead, follow these steps.
Consider supporting them at a premium price or for a limited period of time. You probably already have a few clients in mind that really need to go. For others, raising prices may naturally cause them to look elsewhere. If not initially, then you can score more profit until you tell them you can’t service them anymore. Be sure to give these clients plenty of notice.
As you invest more in commercial growth, understand that your residential revenue will naturally decrease. Adapt by scaling back your marketing budget to generate fewer B2C leads and double down on your efforts to grow commercial landscaping leads.
_adjusted their marketing budget over multiple years to invest heavily in commercially focused marketing assets such as a revision to its website, videos, in-depth blog articles, and case studies. This supports their aggressive growth in the commercial sector._
Focus on building a strong sales and marketing team skilled at securing commercial contracts. The standard networking activities should also be supported by digital content you’ve created. Imagine how compelling it would be for a commercial property manager to receive a series of emails containing commercially focused articles, case studies, and videos.
_. This series of personalized emails with call reminders and tasks helps business developers deliver engaging content to prospective clients._
[RELATED READING: [The Challenge You Face With Serving Both Residential and Commercial Markets - Part 2 - The Ugly Truth](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/challenges-residential-commercial-part-ii)]
Pivoting your business strategy is not a decision to be taken lightly. You’re going to need to ask yourself hard questions and make even tougher decisions.
Joining a peer group may also be helpful. Many industry consultants build groups with specific clientele focuses. You could learn a lot from these courageous business owners who repositioned their companies. 
Likewise, not all understand the unique intricacies of supporting digital marketing and sales efforts for commercial landscapers. Find a marketing partner who understands the nuances of growing these types of businesses vs. a residentially-focused company. 
Remember, running a business is not for the faint of heart. Yet, those courageous enough to embrace change often find themselves on paths paved with opportunity and growth. If you believe that commercial landscaping is the future of your business, create clear goals and a plan and stick with it.

I graduated with a degree in Horticulture from Michigan State University and have been entrenched in the green industry for over 20 years. During those years I've dug, trenched, and trimmed with the best of ya'll.
I operated my own successful landscape design firm for seven years prior to launching Landscape Leadership. Yes, I miss it sometimes. I miss the creativity and selling the "big idea" to my clients. I don't necessarily miss overseeing the construction and dealing with the inevitable follow up :-) I'll admit, I was a total design snob.
I absolutely love where I'm at today with our team at Landscape Leadership, assisting some of the best companies in our industry with their marketing and truly impacting their bottom lines.
I've lived in Austin, TX for over a decade now, originally a transplant from the midwest and the great state of Michigan.
Either at my WeWork coworking space taking advantage of the free coffee or at my home office being distracted by my family.
Smart, creative, driven, down to earth... I can't imagine working in any other industry. And the work our clients do: gorgeous swimming pools, beautiful masonry work, elaborate outdoor kitchens... Are you kidding me!?!?

We perform a Total Growth Review for each of our clients and work together to customize their game plan each year. This will detail costs and campaigns to grow leads to specific service divisions.
Unfortunately, no. Digital campaigns are all part of a more comprehensive strategy in an annual engagement.
Most campaigns such as content marketing, email marketing, etc. are most effective when ran year-round. However, we understand there is seasonality to the green industry, so most of our clients run paid ad campaigns anywhere from 5-12 months throughout the year.
ROI is easily measured in some campaigns such as Google Ads. We often see a cost per lead of anywhere from $10-$35/lead. However, other initiatives such as SEO and blogging are long-term approaches that pay dividends for years which is harder to calculate. We will utilize customized dashboards, monthly meetings, and frequent check-ins to give you peace of mind that your strategy is working.
Absolutely. We want you to be able to measure the success of all of your campaigns. For many clients, we help to create print media and set up landing pages and call tracking phone numbers to help you measure the results of what you’re spending with other advertisers.

More sales, higher closing rates, & fewer proposals falling through the cracks
Your green industry software may do a decent job at estimating, running financials, and scheduling work. However, it’s likely a bit soft on the sales management side.
You have more activities to measure than just proposals. To have an effective and efficient landscaping sales organization, it’s critical to evaluate all sales activities in real time. And, if you implement another piece of software, your people need to love using it. This is where HubSpot can help your landscaping or lawn care company.
HubSpot is a robust tool. However, we’ve customized this tool and trained sales teams to close deals faster and make selling landscaping more enjoyable.Some of the helpful features in the HubSpot Sales hub:


Landscape Leadership® offers custom HubSpot setup and training starting at $12,000.
We know that setting up tools is only part of the picture. Your sales team needs to follow a defined process. They need training on how to consciously use their skills to move opportunities through the pipeline.
Landscape Leadership® also offers on-site, group training to teach this process and skills to your team. This is a 1-day workshop followed by weekly virtual meetings over the next 8 weeks.
This defined sales process and your team's activities can be measured in the HubSpot Sales software, helping you to have a better handle on your sales organization!
Landscape Leadership® offers sales skills training starting at $12,000 (based on class size of 10).
> Our sales team absolutely loves how much information they get about prospective clients. We can see what content they've viewed on our website which leads to more meaningful conversations. The Landscape Leadership team also did a fantastic job at training us on HubSpot's sales tools which have helped us to simplify processes, improve close rates, and improve the customer experience.

Software: Landscape Leadership® will customize HubSpot based on your company and its sales processes. We’ll teach users how to use the tool and perform audits in the first year. Additional training can also be purchased. HubSpot also has an extensive knowledge base as well as a support team available to all users.
Sales Skills Training: We offer on-site group training to improve your team's sales skills. This also includes 2 months of ongoing support calls to ensure your team is following the processes.

TM has worked with many successful companies in the landscaping industry, helping them to define their processes and mentoring sales managers to become effective coaches, keeping their team accountable.
Can I hire you for just sales enablement or sales skills training?
We can perform HubSpot Sales Enablement as a standalone project or you can also include it in a more comprehensive annual marketing and sales agreement.
Sales skills training is only offered to clients who have gone through HubSpot Sales Enablement setup and training. 
Unfortunately, not at this time. This is due to these Green Industry CRMs having closed systems and APIs. However, we’ve had many discussions with these software companies and we are hopeful this will happen in the next few years
Green industry software often lacks important features when it comes to its CRM and sales components. Our clients prefer HubSpot for its CRM and sales tools and feel it’s a worthwhile addition to their technology stack. After proposals are signed, they then add work orders in their green industry software to perform the remaining operational and financial functions.
