## Potential Market Opportunities & Gaps

A new agency can differentiate and capture unmet needs by:

- **Serving Small & Mid-Sized Businesses:**  
  Offer solutions for companies below the "multi-million dollar" level ([source](https://lawnline.marketing/#:~:text=Lawnline%20Marketing%3A%20All,in%20the%20US%20and%20Canada)), such as tiered or starter packages.

- **Adding Traditional Marketing Services:**  
  Include direct mail, print, vehicle wraps, yard signs, and local event marketing—no current specialist offers these prominently.

- **Transparent & Flexible Pricing:**  
  Publish starting prices or package options, or offer month-to-month agreements with clear deliverables ([source](https://allscapesmarketing.com/#:~:text=,LANDSCAPING%20BUSINESS)).

- **Unique Value Proposition:**  
  Introduce proprietary technology (e.g., custom reporting dashboards, AI tools) or performance-based pricing models.

- **Sub-Niche or Regional Specialization:**  
  Focus on a specific sub-niche (e.g., tree service companies) or region (e.g., cold climate landscaping), tailoring all content and services accordingly.
