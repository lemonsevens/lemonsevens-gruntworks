### Generate leads for services such as fertilization, weed control, aeration, and seeding.
As a turf and lawn care provider, you know that quality customers provide recurring income for years, which is the key to creating a successful business for the long-term. Unfortunately, these types of customers don't just fall on your doorstep. With our web design, search engine optimization, and online marketing services, we'll make sure these customers find you online when searching for fertilization, weed control, aeration, and a variety of other services you offer.
Looking for information about web design and marketing for lawn mowing and maintenance? 
Fertilization and weed control are the top services for most lawn and turf care providers. **In order to generate consistent fertilization and weed leads from the Internet, you must first get in front of them using your website.** The most effective methods are through organic rankings and paid advertisements on search engines like Google. We've also seen some success utilizing paid advertisements on social media websites like Facebook.
Here's a screenshot of a customer's website form submissions. 
Regardless of credibility or competition, **if your website isn't properly built, it will be tough for you to rank organically on search engines like Google.** We're not only talking about technical aspects of SEO, but we're also talking about the written text content. We create pages on your website dedicated to each service and write custom, educational, and targeted content for you.
An example of a dedicated service page would be creating a page for Fertilization Services. Within the web page, we would discuss points such as:


Want to see a real fertilization web page that we've created? Head over to 
Building your website to rank organically is a great, long-lasting approach. However, **if you need to generate leads now, then you're going to be interested in paid advertisements.** Utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook Ads, you can generate leads from your website for lawn care services rather quickly.
Many businesses are skeptical of paid advertisements because they've had a bad experience in the past and wasted money. To be successful with paid advertising, the following elements must be perfectly executed:
  * Targeting searchers/audiences that will actually sign up for your service
  * Separating your advertisements to be specific to a service and not generalized
  * Dedicated landing pages on your website with strong calls-to-action and differentiators (like reviews)


As with any web design or marketing agency, don't just believe everything we tell you. Instead, We recommend you and check out a few of the websites we've built. Here are some of our clients that offer turf care services such as fertilization, weed control, aeration, and more.
## We're the top-rated web design and marketing agency for lawn care companies. Let's get started with a phone call.
All of our customers can't be wrong. **We've worked with over 150 companies in the green industry,** many of them focusing on lawn care services. Take the first step today and give us a call at to discuss web design and online marketing services to grow your lawn care business.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/about

My name is Tony Ricketts and I founded Lawnline Marketing in 2016, however, our history goes back much further.
In May of 2007, I started Ricketts Web Design, where my team and I provided high-end websites, custom applications, and online marketing services to all industries. For 9 years, we worked with around 80 companies and generated millions of dollars in revenue for our clients. After years of success and fast growth, I realized we were spending significant amounts of time and resources to learn about each client's industry. Although this contributed heavily to our success, we needed to make a change.
In 2015, I decided we needed to concentrate on a single industry, enabling us to become the best in that space and saving tons of resources. We already had a few clients in the green industry and knew it pretty well, so it was naturally a good fit. After almost a year of planning and systems development, my team and I launched Lawnline Marketing and stopped taking on new clients at Ricketts Web Design.
Producing the same high-end websites and implementing the same marketing strategies, client after client saw huge success. Since our launch, we've grown our customer base to over 200 lawn and landscape companies across the country.
They were great! We discussed everything we needed in a website and they delivered. We started receiving bid request right away from the new website. One of the greatest things about it is that we still have full control of the website, we have access to all of the controls but they are there if we have any questions and always very responsive. I had a question on a Sunday and they responded right away. Highly Recommend.
Tony and the crew at Lawnline, thanks so much for a job well done. I was so nervous hiring someone to take care of my website design and marketing, it took me 2 seasons to make that decision. It is hard to spend money on services you know nothing about but you all walked me thru it step by step and I really appreciated that. We are only a month into our campaign and my biggest concern now is keeping up with the work, what a great problem to have. I would highly recommend you to anyone.
Thanks to Tony and his team for creating the very website we were envisioning! We were in need of an updated site, and I knew from my very first phone call with Tony that Lawnline was the company who could help us best. From start to finish they guided us along and were extremely knowledgeable. Requested changes were made within hours, and phone calls returned promptly. I would highly recommend Lawnline Websites!

Around 3.5 billion Google searches are performed every day, as people are using the Internet more and more to look for potential restaurants, hotels, hair salons, and lawn care/landscaping services. **It's more important than ever to have an active Internet presence** in order to not only have a successful business but also to grow that business.
The first key element in having an active Internet presence for green industry businesses is to have a website that is properly designed. That proper website design has many different parts that make it work well and perform on search engines. **Learn about web design and why your green industry business needs it.**
Web design **centers around creating a website for your green industry business** that lives on the Internet. The website is a collection of pages with text, words, and images that outline your business and take a deep dive into the services your company offers, whether that be lawn care, landscaping, custom hardscaping, irrigation, or more.
Basically, —a virtual brochure that potential clients can browse through and view examples of your work while learning more about your company.
Imagine the outside of a business that looks unkempt. Would you immediately judge the business by how its exterior looks? More than likely, you would—especially as a lawn care professional. It's the same with your company website. More often than not, **your website is the first thing that potential customers will see.** If they access your site and see sloppy design, misspellings, inaccuracies, and more, they are less likely to choose to do business with you.
**When your website is professionally done, looks timely, and represents your business well,** customers will be more impressed and consider using your services over a competitor. Having good, solid web design is key to the success of your business. A website represents your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and **you want to ensure anything or anyone representing your company is constantly giving off a good impression.**
Other reasons your green industry company needs web design include:
  * It allows , what you do, and where you do it
  * It allows you to in photo galleries or project case studies
  * It gives you a chance to directly from the internet


In order to generate new, unique content specifically tailored to your company, optimize your photos for search engines, and more, it can take Lawnline Marketing up to 4-5 weeks or more depending on how many services are offered. Other web designers could take more or less time depending on their website build process.
When considering a new website, just remember this: **your website should end up making you money. It's an investment, not a cost.**
## Are you ready to create a website for your green industry business?
At Lawnline Marketing, we have green industry clients across the country who constantly see new leads coming in through the websites and other services we offer for them. We'd love to discuss marketing strategies with you. Give us a call at or submit an online form and one of our team members will get back to you about your website!

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/industries/irrigation

### Organic search engine optimization and paid advertising generate irrigation leads.
When you hire our team to handle lead generation for your irrigation/sprinkler company, we make sure you can be found where everyone is searching for your services—Google. In our experience, social media websites, like Facebook, don't produce near the results that search engines do. To make sure you appear on search engines, **we balance search engine optimization (SEO) services to get you organic (free) rankings, while complementing with paid advertisements** to generate business immediately.
For irrigation leads, Google is by far the best source. Balancing organic SEO efforts with paid advertisements is the most effective approach.
## How we get irrigation companies to the top of Google's organic rankings.
Getting your irrigation/sprinkler company to rank organically (free) on Google starts with the initial web design and development process. **We build your website to target people the way they look for your services.** This means we create pages dedicated to the individual services people search for, such as installations, repairs, upgrades, and winterization. On each page, we write quality and unique content that is detailed and educates the visitor about the service. We also implement geographic signals so the search engines know where you offer your services. A few of the location signals we use include local contact info, strategic content writing, headlines, metadata, schema markup, and geotagging imagery.
Building the website properly is great, but organic SEO doesn't end there. **Outside of your website, we handle tasks such as citation creation, social media engagements, review building, and more.** As we pair off-site SEO efforts with the on-site SEO efforts, your website will start moving to the top of Google's organic rankings.
Marketing on Google is done through its advertising platform called AdWords. This is a pay-per-click model that can be very effective for irrigation companies because the competition is usually pretty low. This enables you to drive qualified visitors to your website for less money than other related services. Also, **when someone clicks your ad, we know exactly what they are searching for and can tailor their experience** to that, unlike organic rankings.
In order for paid ads on Google to be successful, it requires more than just a simple set up. AdWords is a complicated system, and when done poorly, you'll lose a lot of money with no results. Here are a few of the things we do to create successful campaigns for sprinkler companies:
  * We create ads to focus on a single service. For example, we'll create an ad group that focuses on irrigation repair, and another that focuses on irrigation installation.
  * We stop Google from automating things that can bring down your performance, such as ad optimization. We always write at least 3 ads and constantly drop the worst-performing.
  * These stop you from showing up for irrelevant search terms. For example, when someone is searching for irrigation licenses or irrigation laws, we make sure you aren't shown.
  * We create separate pages with strong call-to-actions and differentiators that paid advertising leads land on. These are different from your service pages. Pages that convert leads and pages for search engines are vastly different.


The 4 items listed above are just a couple of things we do. **Other important aspects include extensions, geographic targeting, conversion tracking, and much more.** If you'd like to learn more about our approach to paid ads, just give us a call at .
With paid ads, we know exactly what the visitor is looking for, and we give them exactly that. Then, using strong calls-to-action and differentiators (like reviews), the leads start to roll in.
Whether you provide irrigation services exclusively, or it is one of many services, we can help you generate more business. Check out some of these customers that rely on our website design, SEO, and marketing services to generate irrigation leads.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/advertising

## Online advertising services that generate leads for lawn care, landscaping, tree services, nurseries, and other green industry businesses.
As a and the top-rated online advertising agency for green industry companies, We work with companies in lawn care, landscaping, hardscaping, tree services, irrigation, and nurseries. The most common platforms we use for advertising include Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Facebook. We also utilize many different types of ads, including search ads, remarketing ads, and display ads.
Our strategy for advertising depends on the services you offer.
**The whole point of doing any kind of marketing is to generate leads.** In order to do this effectively, our strategy changes based on the types of services you offer. For example, if you want to grow your lawn mowing and maintenance services, we'll focus on Google Search Ads and Facebook Promotional Ads. If you want to grow your hardscaping services, we'll focus on Google Search Ads, paired with Google and Facebook Remarketing.
If you do a Google search for "good Google ads conversion rate", you'll find varying opinions, but most will say that around 5% is a good target, and 10% is great. Here at Lawnline Marketing, We've even had customers sustain at a 30%+ conversion rate. So how do we do it? Simple—we run the ads properly! Doing it right takes a lot more work, but the results are worth it.
Ads are created to target a specific keyword and are only paired with very close variations.
One main reason for Google Ads failures. We make sure you only show for relevant searches.
With our experience and piles of data, we know what encourages people to click your ad.
We don't let Google auto-optimize, we use human eyes to handle all optimizations weekly.
Extensions = more visibility. We use them all properly, including direct call and site links.
Ever seen the one ad under the local map result? We know how to place you there.
We ensure your ads are properly shown geographically, and at high conversion times.
This is our secret sauce. Each advertisement gets its own strategically created landing page.
As mentioned above, the strategy used for your online advertisements depends on the services you offer. Two important parts of the strategy are the platform to utilize and the type of advertisement. Here are the types of advertisements we run for our clients:
  * These are the standard pay-per-click ads you see at the top of the Google search engine. This is the only way to guarantee a first page ranking on Google and they usually have the best results. These are standard for almost every service in the green industry.
  * Sometimes, Google allows this one advertisement to show up under the map on local searches. This is a specialized placement that requires certain parameters to be met but results in very high click-through rates. This placement is utilized for most services in the green industry.
  * Ever been to a website and then saw their banner ads everywhere you went? That's Google remarketing. This type of advertisement works well for long sales processes, such as landscaping, hardscaping, and outdoor living spaces.
  * This is a type of advertisement that works similarly to remarketing, except you target people who have an interest in services you offer or who visited your competitor websites. These ads work well for higher-dollar projects like landscape and hardscape installs.
  * These search ads are exactly the same as Google search ads, but appear on the Bing and Yahoo search engines. They typically have cheaper click prices, but lower search volume. These ads work great for all types of green industry services.
  * We set up your ads on the Facebook network to display to those who live in certain areas, are homeowners, have shown interest in landscaping, and a series of other interests/demographic targeting. This type of advertising is recommended for all types of services but works especially well for lawn care and maintenance.
  * Similar to Google Remarketing, we can show advertisements to people on Facebook that have visited your website before. These work fabulously for landscaping and hardscaping companies.
  * Advertising on LinkedIn is more suitable for those that offer lawn and landscape services to commercial customers. On LinkedIn, we can target people based on positions, industry, and more.
  * This is a type of marketing that uses both demographics/interests and remarketing on all social media websites you're active on, such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Instead of promoting your services, we promote content, such as project case studies. Content marketing is a key element for hardscaping and other high-cost services. People respond to these so well because you advertise by providing ideas and education, not a sales pitch.


Ask us about which advertising platforms are most effective for your services.

## Websites, SEO, and marketing services for hardscape and outdoor living contractors.
### Generate leads for outdoor kitchens, patios, walkways, fire pits, and more!
We love doing web design, search engine optimization (SEO), and online marketing for hardscaping contractors because of the challenges we must overcome. Many of our hardscape clients design and build outdoor living spaces that cost into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, we also work with hardscape clients that do smaller projects such as only a paver patio, flagstone walkway, or a fire pit. Generating real quality leads in the hardscape industry requires a creative approach to first qualify a visitor, then convert them to a lead.
Because hardscaping projects require a larger budget, generating leads is far more difficult than other services, such as maintenance or turf management.
## Getting interested homeowners to your website with organic SEO and paid advertisements.
We've found the most effective source for quality hardscaping leads on the Internet is Google. Homeowners go online and search for what they want to build using keywords such as or . When you show up at the top of Google for those searches (whether from paid ads or organic SEO), it becomes much easier to get that homeowner to land on your website and review your services.
**The long-term goal is to gain organic search engine rankings with a properly built website.** For organic SEO, we create pages dedicated to each type of hardscape element you design and build because that is how people search. When you have a page dedicated to outdoor living spaces, your chances to rank organically for that search term increases dramatically. For each page, we do the following tasks:
  * Depending on the type of service the page focuses on (outdoor kitchen, patio, etc), we'll educate the visitor about the types of materials you use, available options, planning/rendering software, and any other important details.
  * If a visitor is viewing a page about outdoor kitchens, we'll embed a gallery on that page featuring only your outdoor kitchen projects. If you have videos, those also work very well. We also handle the technical SEO parts (file naming, compression, alt text, geotag).
  * All throughout the page, we embed geographic signals to communicate to the search engines where you provide your services. This includes the proper use of metadata, headlines, content, and even imagery geotagging.


**To get homeowners to your website immediately, we use Google Ads and Facebook Ads.** Utilizing these platforms, we can ensure your website is put in front of people that are looking for your services in your areas.
For Google Ads, we drive new visitors using to focus on each service. We have strong negative keyword lists that ensure you only show up for quality and relevant searches. We also , which means targeting people who are interested in your services or competitors based on their web browsing history and actions.
For Facebook Ads, we drive new visitors using to audiences based on their interests and demographics. For example, we can place your advertisement in front of an audience that matches all of these criteria: married women, homeowners, over 30 years old, and interested in outdoor living spaces.
After getting a visitor to your website, we qualify them by creating project case studies to visually demonstrate your typical project and customer.
## We use project case studies and remarketing to nurture the visitor until they are ready for a consultation.
Many hardscape leads, especially those looking for bigger projects like full outdoor living spaces, don't reach out the first time they visit your website. Typically, they start off looking for ideas and research potential contractors that are in the area. It could take up to 6 months or a year before the customer decides they are ready to move forward. This is where project case studies and remarketing really shine.
**Project case studies are pages on your website dedicated to a single project.** You simply send us any photos or videos you have of the project and we handle the rest. From looking at the photos, we can determine what you've designed and built, along with the materials used and options that were chosen. We'll create a detailed write-up describing the project and create galleries that showcase your before, during, and after photos. We typically also integrate social media sharing functionality and Facebook comments.
To see a live example of a project case study for a hardscape project, click the following image.
**Project case studies are magnets for potential design and build customers.** Utilizing remarketing, we place your project case studies in front of people who have already been to your website and expressed interest in certain services. We push these case studies on their Facebook wall, their Instagram page, and on other websites they frequently visit. When someone is serious about building an outdoor living space, and you put an article in front of them to get ideas for outdoor living spaces from your previous project, they are going to check it out. When the time comes that they are ready to move forward, you've been in front of them the entire time.
Building positive online reviews for your company is a very easy way to gain a leg up on the competition. **Studies have shown that consumers trust online reviews as much as they do a personal referral.** With hardscaping projects, you can bet that potential customers are going to research your company. If they are met with a slew of positive reviews, that will give them the confidence needed to place high consideration on you as their contractor.
Helping our hardscape contractors build reviews is one small part of the services we offer. We'll direct your customers to the appropriate places online that will have the biggest impact and most visibility. Also, it doesn't hurt that Google places a high priority on reviews for organic rankings!
## We've helped generate millions in revenue for our hardscaping clients—take a look at a few of them.
We provide web design, SEO, and marketing services for several hardscape contractors that bring numerous new clients and millions of dollars worth of revenue. With our experience, we've learned what consumers respond to and how to generate the leads that turn into real customers. Take a look at a few of the hardscape companies that we've worked with below.

## Using organic SEO, search engine advertising, and social media, we'll generate quality landscaping leads for you.
### First, we build a great website. Then, we drive traffic to generate leads.
Building a website and online presence that generates leads for landscape design and installation services requires a different approach than other services, such as mowing or fertilization. Because landscaping services cost considerably more than maintenance and care, the sales process is much longer. This is where having a quality website properly structured and strategic advertising efforts can really pay off.
## Converting landscape design and installation leads requires more than a pretty website—it needs meat, like project case studies.
When a customer is considering spending thousands of dollars on landscaping, **you must prove that you're the best contractor for the job.** The most effective method to achieve this on your website is by Of course, you also need pages on your website that describe your services (for search engine purposes), but those aren't the ones that will convince the visitor to convert to a lead.
Using project case studies, a potential lead can see real examples of your work on a per-project basis. We're talking about written descriptions of the tasks you performed, the plants/materials used, before/after photos, video, and more. This allows the visitor to see your work in detail and generate ideas for their own project, as well as constantly providing fresh content for your website, social media platforms, and remarketing efforts. **Creating project case studies is something our team will handle for you, along with utilizing them on the proper channels.**
Click the image below to see an example of a project case study.
## Paid advertisements get you in front of quality customers and remarketing helps them choose you.
To get you in front of quality landscape customers, utilizing both Google and Facebook in different ways is an effective approach. Your target customers search Google for your services, just like they do anything else, so we're sure to put you there. However, the unique approach comes from social media and remarketing. Here's a summary of our paid marketing tactics that gets results for landscapers:
  1. Drive visitors to dedicated landing pages when they search for target keywords, such as .
  2. After someone visits your landing pages, your banner and video ads follow the potential lead around the Internet.
  3. Target audiences that have been searching for landscaping services, as well as those that have already been to your landing pages. Instead of showing them promotional advertisements, we show them your projects and indirectly advertise to them in the form of providing ideas for their own project.


Search ads paired with constantly keeps you in front of the customer. When they decide to reach out to contractors, they have consistently seen your work and been to your website many times.
Review building is a service we offer with our website design and marketing services. We take a specific approach to get your customers to leave online reviews on the platforms that matter. **Search engines like Google place a high priority on reviews for organic rankings.** Also, potential customers trust online reviews as much as they do a referral. When combining consistent positive reviews with the website and marketing approach mentioned above, we create a lead generation machine for landscaping companies. Don't worry, we also handle getting your customers to leave you a review and make it easy for them.
Reviews like the one below are what landscaping companies should strive for. Potential leads see real people vouching for your business, along with a few photos of the work performed.
## We help landscaping companies grow every day. Here are just a few of them.
Working with a web design and online marketing agency that knows your business is key. **When you hire us, you don't need to educate us about your services or how to market your business.** Since we only work in the green industry, we have tons of experience, data, and insights from working with companies just like yours. Here are a few of our landscaping companies.
## We're the #1 rated agency serving the green industry—give us a call to learn why.

**When done properly, Google and Facebook are both excellent sources of leads, right in your prime service area.** For example, with Google, you can target searchers within a mile of your business' physical location.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/industries/nurseries

## Generating leads for nurseries and growers from search engines and social media.
### Depending on if you sell to the public, or only wholesale determines our approach.
As a web design and marketing company, it's no surprise we use the Internet to generate leads for nurseries and growers. However, the **strategy is adjusted based on if you sell to the** We provide organic search engine optimization (SEO) services for both business types. However, paid marketing and social media strategies are very different for retail and wholesale nurseries.
## Organic SEO, paid advertisements, and Facebook creates new business for retail nurseries.
For nurseries that sell to the public, there are many sources for lead generation. **The most effective methods we've found are both Google and Facebook.** With Google, we target organic rankings, local map rankings, and paid advertisements. On Facebook, we do paid ads, but a solid content marketing strategy is more effective.
To build organic Google rankings for a retail nursery, it all starts with the initial web design services. We create pages dedicated to what terms people search for. For example, if you're in the south, we'll create a page dedicated to selling palm trees. We also create pages dedicated to selling fruit trees. **We create pages like these because that is how people search.** Of course, we also have pages that cover the nursery in general, as well as any additional products you may supply, such as mulch, soil, fertilizers, and tools. We also utilize Google AdWords (paid ads) to ensure new customers can always find you.
To generate leads from Facebook, we do promotional advertisements, but By building an audience, we can reach your followers and their friends. We'll create engaging content on your website, share it on your Facebook wall, then promote it to a targeted audience, which is very effective in generating new business. A great example would be when it's annual flower season, or when you have special deals.
Content marketing on Facebook generates results for retail nurseries. See an example below about annual flowers.
## For wholesale growers and nurseries, we help bring new retailers and landscaping companies.
For nurseries and growers that only sell wholesale, we help your two biggest customer bases—retailers and landscaping companies—find you. **There are 3 strategies we use, which include organic SEO for local customers, paid advertisements for non-local, and LinkedIn advertising.**
We use SEO for local customers because Google is very strict about their organic rankings. Unless your online presence is already very strong, it is difficult to rank your website in areas that are not local to you. For this reason, we use a paid marketing strategy on Google to reach customers outside of your local area.
What makes this social media website a great source of leads for wholesale nurseries is it is very business to business-focused. We can create advertisements that put you in front of landscaping and retail nursery owners.
When marketing wholesale nurseries, we use SEO for your local area and Google ads everywhere else. We also utilize LinkedIn marketing to put you in front of target business owners.
We work with companies serving the green industry, which includes nurseries and growers. Listed below are a few of the nurseries for which we are currently providing website design, SEO, and/or online marketing services.
## Call today to discuss your website and online marketing needs.
Ready to start taking advantage of the Internet and generating new business for your nursery? Give us a call at and we'll discuss your business and how we can help to see if we'd be a good fit for each other.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/industries/tree-services

## Lead generation services for tree companies using online marketing and search engine optimization (SEO).
### We put your business in front of customers searching for tree services.
After providing web design and marketing services for many arborists and tree service companies, we can tell you from experience that To get in front of customers, we'll utilize paid marketing/advertisements on search engines and social media websites, as well as organic rankings on search engines like Google. To convert website visitors to leads, we show you're the best option by creating a professional image, writing content that demonstrates knowledge, using imagery from past work, highlighting customer reviews, and communicating proper licensing and insurance coverage.
The key to generating leads for tree services is driving potential customers to your website, then convincing them you're the best choice.
## Marketing and SEO get you in front of potential customers.
When talking about **the best source for tree service leads, Google is king.** If you add all the leads together that you can get from the other search engines and social media websites, it won't be half of what Google can deliver.
We go after both organic (free) rankings and paid advertisements on Google. We target keywords such as , , and , to name a few. Starting off, it all begins with the initial web design process. To properly structure your website, we build pages dedicated to those services. Simply put, if someone is looking for tree removal service, and you have a page dedicated to tree removal service, then you'll have a better chance of ranking.
Facebook marketing is also another avenue we use. Though it does not deliver as many leads as Google, **Facebook can deliver a decent amount of business for not a lot of money.** Facebook also has tracking that allows us to target users with advertisements that are interested in tree services, and also by demographics.
If you are a properly licensed and insured tree service, then convincing your website visitors to convert to leads isn't hard. **The main thing customers look for is professionalism, experience, and insurance.** Put another way, if you're going to be dropping a several-thousand-pound tree on their property, they want to make sure you know what you're doing and that you're covered if anything goes wrong. We show your website visitors that you're the best choice by using the following methods:
  * We create detailed services pages that communicate your knowledge and professionalism
  * Embed imagery and video showing you doing the work they are hiring you for
  * Showcase any customer reviews that can vouch for your services


When done right, your website will generate leads like shown below. **Note, this image is only showing form submissions and does not count phone call leads.**
Don't just take our word that our services work. Check out a few of the arborists and tree companies that are currently using our services and rely upon us to generate quality leads.
## Ready to start generating leads from the Internet? Let's talk.
If you're ready to **work with the top-rated agency for generating tree service leads** from the Internet, give us a call at . We'll discuss your business and how we can help with web design, marketing, and SEO services. We also recommend that you do your research on us, starting with

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/industries/outdoor-lighting

## Website, marketing, and lead generation services for outdoor lighting companies.
### We use an approach that mixes web design, SEO, paid ads, and social media.
As with anything else, homeowners use the Internet to find services they need, including outdoor and landscape lighting contractors. To generate outdoor lighting leads from the Internet, we use a combination of organic search engine optimization, search engine advertising, and marketing on social media. We have also seen success in remarketing landscape lighting services to your audience on Facebook.
Many times, landscape and outdoor lighting are not as competitive online as other green industry services. This makes it a easier to rank organically on search engines like Google.
As with any other organic SEO, it all starts with your website. For companies that have a high focus on outdoor lighting, we take an approach similar to that of hardscaping. **We'll break out pages on your website that focus on services** such as:
Here's a screenshot from one of our outdoor lighting contractor client's homepage:
On these individual lighting pages, we focus on the details and educating the visitor. When we write the content, we'll discuss things such as lighting techniques, LED lighting system benefits, and rendering software. **By writing detailed content and properly using geographic signals, your outdoor lighting company's website will be in a position to start ranking on Google.** Of course, there are additional SEO elements that should be done such as citations, review building, creating social engagements, and attracting inbound links, all of which we can help with.
## Google ads target those actively searching, and Facebook ads target homeowners in the market for outdoor lighting.
When it comes to marketing landscape lighting services, we use paid ads on Google and Facebook. Each platform has its own strengths when it comes to lighting services. For example, **with Google, we can target people directly searching for terms like ".** By sending those searchers to a dedicated landing page and providing strong call-to-actions, we can convert outdoor lighting leads.
On Facebook, people may not search for your services directly, but their interests and activity do get tracked. We can use this data to your advantage and **put your advertisement in front of people that have shown interest in outdoor lighting.** Facebook knows if someone is interested in outdoor lighting based on the Facebook pages they interact with, posts they like, websites they've visited that integrate the tracking pixel, and any other clever ways that Facebook uses. See the following image for a few of the interests we use to target people interested in outdoor lighting on Facebook.
## We have clients that focus solely on outdoor lighting, and others that offer it as one of their many services.
Whether you're strictly an outdoor lighting professional, or you offer it as one of your services, we can help! With our web design, SEO, and online marketing services, we'll bring you new landscape lighting customers and help grow your business.
## Call to discuss web design and marketing services for your outdoor lighting business.
If you're considering working with our team, we recommend and then giving us a call at . We'll discuss your outdoor lighting business and see if we'd be a good fit for each other.

## We help you find employees for your lawn care business so you can support your business growth goals.
### Finding good employees in the green industry isn't easy—leave the searching to us.
When you have a business in the green industry, whether it be landscaping, lawn care, hardscaping, or other sector, it's not always easy to find good, qualified employees. According to the National Association of Landscape Professionals, **finding labor is the biggest challenge that most landscape professionals must conquer** in order to support their business growth goals.

Our applicant tracking system helps us filter out the employees that do not meet your required qualifications and then we pass our recommendations on to you so you can begin the interviewing process.
Our recruiting services are offered to our current ongoing SEO and online advertising customers.
## Why should your lawn and landscaping business focus on a year-round recruiting strategy?
Much like the jobs your company is contracted for, your hiring is typically also seasonal. However, this doesn't mean you should only be hiring once your season rush hits. By , you make it easier to find quality lawn care employees and you're better prepared for the upcoming season. This also gives you time to find employees, train them, and ensure their work will be up to your company standards.
Many prospective landscaping employees are also searching for job opportunities that allow professional growth. Hiring throughout the year **ensures you're able to provide training and put a higher emphasis on continued education** , which can help to increase your employee retention rate as well.
With our , we can help you implement a year-round recruiting strategy so you're constantly able to reach the high caliber of employees that you want to add to your lawn care company's workforce.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/social-media

## Social media can be very effective at generating leads for certain green industries.
### Facebook is by far the most impactful social media platform.
Social media websites, like Facebook, are a great place to generate leads for specific green industry businesses. Most of your customers are on Facebook and advertising on social media websites tends to be far more cost-effective than search engines. Unfortunately, Facebook only lets you reach a very small percentage of your followers. This means if you want to reach people organically, then creating engaging content is critical.
With Facebook marketing, you can reach thousands of potential customers in a cost-effective manner.
## Promotional ads on social media generate leads for lawn care and maintenance services.
If you offer lawn mowing and maintenance, or lawn care services, then When done properly, you can get in front of thousands of homeowners and start getting new leads. The most effective social media marketing efforts are done during the spring and early summer to bring on new clients for the year, as well as during the fall for cleanups. Landscaping and hardscaping services can also benefit from social media promotional ads, but not like lawn care and maintenance.
## Content marketing and remarketing on social media generates leads for landscaping and hardscaping services over time.
If you offer (such as outdoor living spaces), then content marketing and remarketing tend to work well on social media websites like Facebook. However, the strategy must be done correctly to be successful. For example, if you create posts about your services, reviews, awards, or other similar content, you're probably not going to get very far.
To be successful, content must be created that your potential customers want to read. A great example is project case studies. If someone is in the market for an outdoor living space, and you advertise to them using a project case study that shows a new outdoor living space you just designed and built, you're going to see better results.
Instead of promotional advertisements, we market your projects as a way to give potential customers ideas. When they're ready to move forward, your work has been in front of them the entire time.
Do you feel that social media would be a good avenue for your business? If so, call us at . Our consultations are completely free and we'll discuss your goals, what to expect, how we can help, and if social media is a good choice for your business.

If you're in a high-competition city, target the smaller suburb areas with less competition.
Listing your business in the right places - Google, Bing, Angie's List, Houzz, Yellow Pages, etc.
Building online reviews to the strongest platforms that impact your ability to rank on Google.
Create engagement with your business from people on social media and other platforms.
We find what's hurting you and fix them, like link disavows, citation inconsistencies, etc.
## Just as important as the services are keyword research, analytics, tracking, and competitor analysis.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/blog/press-release-lawnline-website-changes-to-lawnline-marketing

Lawnline Websites, one of the green industry’s leading digital marketing agencies, announced earlier this month its decision to begin operating under the name Lawnline Marketing. According to business owner Tony Ricketts, the name change reflects the evolution of the company and his desire to better serve their current and future clients.
“When my original company, Ricketts Web Design, began concentrating on working within a single industry in 2015, I decided to focus on the green industry because it was familiar territory for us”, Ricketts explained. “We were still producing high-end websites to help businesses generate leads, but we've really evolved in the past few years.”
Lawnline Marketing is a top-rated website and marketing agency within the green industry and has served over 200 lawn care, landscape design, and tree service companies nationwide. Tony Ricketts sees this new step forward as an opportunity for the company to build upon the experience they’ve gained working in the green industry by encompassing all that is involved with online marketing.
“Web design, organic SEO, paid advertising, and social media engagement all work together to increase a company’s online exposure, traffic, and lead generation. Our agency needed a name that reflected our team’s extensive knowledge in these areas so potential clients could feel confident when choosing to use our online marketing services.”
Lawnline Marketing is an online marketing agency located in Apollo Beach, FL, just outside of Tampa, FL. The company works with businesses and clients operating in the green industry, such as lawn care, landscaping, nurseries, hardscaping, and more. Their digital advertising services include website design, organic SEO, paid ads, social media, and brand design.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/blog/hiring-an-in-house-marketing-team-vs-a-marketing-agency

### In-house vs specialized marketing agency; which works best for lawn and landscaping companies?
This question has stumped several businesses throughout a variety of industries. Now, many companies probably think that marketing agencies like ours charge tens of thousands of dollars a year, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. And why should someone spend that money out the door when it’s possible to just hire somebody in-house?
The main answer is simply because, when hiring in-house, people are going to spend a whole lot more money for subpar results.
Everything that's involved with digital marketing doesn't happen with just one person. In fact, it takes five people at a minimum to execute our marketing services. Our marketing specialists cover everything from organic SEO to paid advertising and more.
## What roles are needed to properly execute digital marketing tasks?
If hiring in-house, there are really 5 positions you should be hiring. Here is what you'll need:
First, the marketing team will need a good content writer. The content writer needs to understand search engine optimization, how Google's algorithms work, and be creative enough to come up with good topics that can be written properly into long-form blogs the way it should be done.
**Our company has never had one content writer, in all of the content writers we’ve worked with, that has the ability to do this out of the gate.**
That basically means the content writer will have to be trained on how to properly create and write content that will rank for search engines like Google.
The next person that needs to be hired is a web developer or even a senior web developer.
Why a senior web developer? Because a junior web developer may not be capable or have enough experience to put out a website that's going to represent a lawn and landscape business accurately. A senior web developer knows how to code, create web page designs, and can put it all together to make it flow into one seamless user experience.
Asking the right questions during the interview is another aspect of the hiring process. Will the interviewer know what those questions should be? How are they going to vet them? How will they know which are the right questions to ask to gain a better understanding of their skill level?
Understanding all the various social media sites and how they can help build a business is a large part of digital marketing.
Who's going to make sure that the content being posted to the company’s social media platforms are actually going to get engagements and encourage people to click? The more online interaction there is, the more a business will get noticed! This means posts need to be interesting and unique enough to get people sharing the content and commenting on posts.
Part of the job of a social media specialist is also being able to gauge what posts are performing well, which ones aren't, and knowing how to pivot their social media strategy to get more post engagement from their audience.
Plus, how will this specialist know if they're judging the quality of the content correctly? Are they comparing everything to past results or to other companies in the green industry? Do they understand how to advertise a company's brand and services so they stand out, or will it blend in with the other hundreds of lawn and landscaping companies online?
The online ad space is a murky and difficult road to navigate if you don't know how it all works. Some people end up spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on paid advertising and end up being no closer to seeing the number of leads they wanted that year. A paid ads specialist focuses on Google and Microsoft ads specifically, and these platforms are not something that can be learned overnight.
**It’s possible for someone to spend time on these platforms every day for 10+ YEARS and still not have a full understanding of how it all works.**
Paid advertising specialists are also extremely expensive. Just one of these salaries is typically higher than what it costs to pay a digital marketing agency for one full year.
Again, this is only for ONE person. This is where vetting becomes incredibly important. Are all the right questions going to be prepared? Can the paid ads specialist make sure, without a doubt, that they're going to be able to take the company’s marketing budget and get the results that they’re looking for?
While content writers should have some SEO knowledge, they also have other parts of content creation that they have to focus on. An SEO specialist will already have the training and skills needed to help build inbound links the way they should. SEO ensures the right content topics are being chosen and that they're coded properly.
An SEO specialist also makes sure that everything outside and inside of the website is properly written to Google standards, in other words, the way that Google requires people to write content in order to get rankings on their search engines.
During the interview process, the interviewer will have to know what they're talking about, which means they'll need to familiarize themselves with SEO and how it works as well. This is why SEO specialists are extremely expensive.
Just like senior web developers. Just like paid advertising specialists. Just like content writers.
These are all people that need to be hired onto the in-house marketing team, 
Just like with any other full-time employee, the in-house marketing team is going to need benefits. This includes:
The company is responsible for providing them with all these benefits and more. If you want multiple high caliber employees from the marketing industry, you must keep in mind that the tech industry has tons of benefits that landscape companies typically don't have. Because of this, it's going to be harder to pluck one of these senior people out of their current position in the marketing industry and entice them enough to work for a lawn or landscaping company full-time.
These are just a couple of the issues a business is going to face when trying to run its own in-house marketing team.
## Hiring a marketing agency allows lawn and landscape companies to focus on what they do best.
Lawn and landscape companies specialize in either one or even both of these categories, but consider this; what does anybody do when they can’t perform or don’t understand a particular service very well?
Most people hire somebody who is a specialist in that service because it's going to take far more effort to figure it out for themselves. It's easier to find somebody who does it, does it well, and then pay those people to get the job done.
## Our marketing agency has the tools to get lawn and landscape companies the results they want!
It’s wise to keep these things in mind when thinking about hiring a marketing agency versus hiring someone in-house. It's also important to think about the end result. In truth, an in-house marketing team may never come near to the results that our team at Lawnline Marketing produces. Some businesses may hire people they believe to be the best marketing team in the world, and they still aren't going to get the results that we have continuously attained for our past clients.
The reason for this is simply because they don't have the proper training. They don't work with a ton of lawn and landscaping companies every day like we do. They're not going to have the same essential tools available to them as we do.
Did you know that we spend THOUSANDS of dollars a month on marketing tools alone? We use tools that allow us to post across all social media platforms and allow us to pre-schedule every single post. So, not only is the company going to need a team with the proper talent and training, but the marketing team is also going to need the right online marketing tools as well to effectively do their jobs.
**The reality is that if an in-house marketing team falls short on any of these factors, they’re not going to get the results the company is expecting.** Hundreds of thousands of dollars will have ended up being spent on marketing with nothing to show for it.
So when considering hiring an agency like ours, which is going to have the same financial impact on a business as that of a single in-house employee, the reality is, it's a no brainer to hire a marketing agency.
Why? Because we can do it cheaper and we can do it better. It's as simple as that.

In my opinion, I believe hiring an agency has cheaper costs than that of an in-house team, especially an agency that has been established for a number of years as they tend to have a plethora more experience than some people, and it's a combined experience too whereas hiring a couple of people in-house doesn't diversify skillset and could still lead to hiring an agency somewhere along the line anyway

Around 3.5 billion Google searches are performed every day, as people are using the Internet more and more to look for potential restaurants, hotels, hair salons, and lawn care/landscaping services. **It's more important than ever to have an active Internet presence** in order to not only have a successful business but also to grow that business.
The first key element in having an active Internet presence for green industry businesses is to have a website that is properly designed. That proper website design has many different parts that make it work well and perform on search engines. **Learn about web design and why your green industry business needs it.**
Web design **centers around creating a website for your green industry business** that lives on the Internet. The website is a collection of pages with text, words, and images that outline your business and take a deep dive into the services your company offers, whether that be lawn care, landscaping, custom hardscaping, irrigation, or more.
Basically, —a virtual brochure that potential clients can browse through and view examples of your work while learning more about your company.
Imagine the outside of a business that looks unkempt. Would you immediately judge the business by how its exterior looks? More than likely, you would—especially as a lawn care professional. It's the same with your company website. More often than not, **your website is the first thing that potential customers will see.** If they access your site and see sloppy design, misspellings, inaccuracies, and more, they are less likely to choose to do business with you.
**When your website is professionally done, looks timely, and represents your business well,** customers will be more impressed and consider using your services over a competitor. Having good, solid web design is key to the success of your business. A website represents your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and **you want to ensure anything or anyone representing your company is constantly giving off a good impression.**
Other reasons your green industry company needs web design include:
  * It allows , what you do, and where you do it
  * It allows you to in photo galleries or project case studies
  * It gives you a chance to directly from the internet


In order to generate new, unique content specifically tailored to your company, optimize your photos for search engines, and more, it can take Lawnline Marketing up to 4-5 weeks or more depending on how many services are offered. Other web designers could take more or less time depending on their website build process.
When considering a new website, just remember this: **your website should end up making you money. It's an investment, not a cost.**
## Are you ready to create a website for your green industry business?
At Lawnline Marketing, we have green industry clients across the country who constantly see new leads coming in through the websites and other services we offer for them. We'd love to discuss marketing strategies with you. Give us a call at or submit an online form and one of our team members will get back to you about your website!

Utilizing the Internet to gain business is something that all companies, especially service-based companies should be doing. It is a tool that can vastly help you with gaining more leads, growing your business, and finding the best quality jobs.
At Lawnline Marketing, we recommend that lawn care companies use all aspects of the Internet to achieve their goals. Some aspects, like SEO and organic rankings, may take longer. If you’re looking to quickly grow your business and generate more leads, then your best choice is to use online advertising platforms. Learn about online advertising and why your company should use it.
Online advertising is paid ads. In past decades, people would take out classified ads or larger ads in a newspaper. Think of online advertising in that way, except that it’s much easier to get your company name out in front of potential customers. With online advertising, you are paying for top placement on a search engine page to help increase your visibility.
The most popular online advertising platforms are Google, Google Local Services (Google Guarantee), Bing, Facebook, and Instagram. Other platforms that are more lead-generation heavy instead of advertising include sites such as Yelp, Houzz, and Home Advisor.
Online advertising moves quickly—it’s instant gratification. Generally, your company will generate leads within the first week of implementing an ad campaign. When people search for terms such as “lawn care” or “landscape maintenance” your company ads will appear before the first organic search result.
It’s best to tailor your online advertising so that you advertise for services during each peak season. This helps to keep you showing up as high as possible in the search engine results. Online advertising also gives you granular control over what services you display for, whereas organic results are determined by Google.
Online advertising is also a valuable part of remarketing, which is when your ads are shown to people after they’ve visited your website. This helps to keep your company name fresh in potential customers’ minds, especially if they are taking time to consider a large project. Especially for landscape companies, when people visit your website, they are looking to gain more information about your services before jumping into a project.
Remarketing ads can be tailored to pop up on people’s web browsing or social media news feeds for months after they’ve visited your site.
## What Types of Lawn Care Services Does Online Advertising Work Best For?
Online advertising typically generates fantastic results for some services, but not always for some other lawn care services. The best services to target via online advertising are:


This method does not work as well for services such as fertilization and weed control, as the costs tend to be very high and the volume on these is low. Another service that online advertising may not work well for is aeration. While the cost of these ads may be low, not many people search for this service.
## Are you considering an overhaul of your company’s online presence?
At Lawnline Marketing, we create and design websites for green industry clients such as lawn care companies, landscape maintenance professionals, design/build companies, and more. We provide online advertising services for our website clients to help them grow their business and find new leads.
If you’re looking for Internet marketing services, then give us a call today at (813) 944-3400 to discuss how our strategies can help you dominate the Internet and generate more business.

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/blog/how-to-get-your-customers-to-leave-an-online-review

Whether you're providing lawn care, landscaping, or hardscaping services, online reviews help you get more leads and close more deals. We all know this and many studies have proven it. What you may not know is that **online reviews help increase your organic rankings, especially in map results.** The problem is getting your customers to take the time to leave a review. Two common questions we get regarding online reviews include:
  1. What's the best approach for getting customers to leave a review?
  2. Should I give some kind of incentive to get a customer to leave a review?


If leaving a review requires many steps, then you're working against yourself. For example, telling your customers "_go to Google, search XYZ Landscaping, make sure it brings up our Google listing, then select Write Review_ ", you're going to struggle to get reviews. Fix this by creating direct links to where you want to build reviews.
To create direct review links, set them up as redirects on your website. Depending on your website platform, this can be done many different ways. If you're one of our customers, just go to Settings > Redirects on your admin control panel. This enables you to have links such as:
  * redirects to your [Google My Business listing with the review box popped up.](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7035772)


Based on reports from our clients, we've found that asking for a review in-person, after a completed job, is by far the most successful approach. Just ask your customer if they'd be willing to leave an online review, and after they agree, take out your cell phone and 
> When asking in-person and texting direct links, 50% to 70% of lawn and landscape customers will leave a review.
Sending an email to ask for a review is effective, even months after you've completed a job for a customer. For the best results, **send a personal email that looks like an ordinary email** , not one that looks like a promotional email with a bunch of graphics and colors. The email should look like you've taken the time to type it up yourself, specifically for the customer. Here is a script we use on behalf of our clients.
I wanted to reach out and let you know that we very much appreciate you as a customer and your support for our business. I would also like to ask if you could write an online review about your experience with XYZ Landscaping? If you're willing to do so, we'd appreciate it very much!
We've made it easy to leave a review on our Google page, just follow this link: http://xyzlandscaping.com/google-review.
You can also leave a review on our Facebook page by following this link: http://xyzlandscaping.com/facebook-review.
Again, we sincerely thank you for your business and support as a customer! Your review would mean the world to us.
Based on our data, you'll see about **30% to 40% of customers will leave a review after receiving the initial email request.** For those that don't leave a review, wait 10 days and send a follow-up email. Here is the script we use for the follow-up.
We recently completed some work on your property and thank you for supporting local business. I wanted to ask, once more, if you'd be willing to tell others about your experience working with XYZ Landscaping, by writing an online review. Your review will be tremendously helpful in growing our business, so we've made it very easy for you. If you click this link, http://xyzlandscaping.com/google-review, you'll be taken to our Google page and the review box will pop right up. Again, thank you for being a great customer.
**After sending a follow-up email, we typically see another 10% to 15% of customers leave a review.**
> When asking through an email, we see 30% to 50% of lawn and landscaping customers will leave a review.
## In conclusion, make it easy and just ask for the review.
As you can see, there is no need to provide any kind of incentive to get a review from your customer. In fact, it is against Google's to offer a monetary incentive for reviews, therefore, we can't recommend it. If you just make it easy with direct links and ask nicely, you'll find that many of your customers will happily leave you a review.
Have you used another approach to encourage your customers to leave an online review? If so, we want to hear about it! Tell us in the comments how you build reviews and what types of results you see. We love data from others!

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/blog/review-building-strategy-to-increase-your-search-engine-rankings

As with just about anything in business, it isn’t enough to know that something is important. It is perhaps more vital to understand why that item is important and how it can be leveraged through a viable strategy.
With this core sentiment in mind, we will use this post to explore a strategy for engaging your customers, with the goal of receiving reviews from them. We will also address why reviews are such an important aspect of increasing your search engine rankings.
To explain the strategy in broad strokes, you first set up a system to request reviews. Next, you focus on obtaining reviews on the most impactful search and social platforms, then expand to home service platforms, then expand to general directories, and finally, make sure to maintain a consistent effort over time.
Now that we have sketched out the outline of what will become your strategic masterpiece, let’s go ahead and paint in the details.
The initial step in your strategy is to . In doing so, you will want to , as was discussed in [our previous article about how to get your customers to leave an online review](https://lawnline.marketing/blog/how-to-get-your-customers-to-leave-an-online-review/). Also, offer at least two platforms that they can leave a review on.
Many times you’ll find that your customers will leave a review on more than one platform if they are offered the options.
Use this opportunity to establish a good foundation for your future reviews. **Focus first on clients that you know are happy with your work**.
Without a doubt, the two **most impactful platforms for reviews are Google and Facebook, with Google being the more influential** of the two, and the first option you should give to your clients.
Many of our clients ask, "what if my customer doesn't have a Google account?". It would be safe to say that a majority of the population has a Google account, one reason being almost everyone with an Android device has a Google account. If they really don't have a Google account, that is why you offer multiple options for platforms.
Once you have acquired at least ten reviews on Google, funnel your customers more towards Facebook, by listing it first in your communications for review requests.
When you have built up your Google and Facebook reviews to the point that there are now multiple reviews on both platforms, it is safe to expand the review options to **include home service websites like Angie’s List, Houzz, Thumbtack, and Porch**.
General directories can be added as well, such as . Make sure that these extra options are additions to Google and Facebook, and not replacements for them. Also, try not to overwhelm your clients. Keep the review platform offerings to 4 or 5 at the most.
To reap the most benefit from this strategy, it is vital that you put out a sustained effort. We recommend that **new requests for reviews should be sent at least once per month**.
So now, let’s address exactly why reviews are important. First of all, reviews are so important for the simple fact that they greatly impact your rankings on search engine result pages (SERPs). This is especially true if you do a search for a business on Google Maps and also for local map pack results, which are the limited number of sites that appear under a map on a standard Google search for local services.
Following the advice we presented, regarding maintaining a level of consistency with requests for reviews, should yield you more reviews on a consistent basis over time. And, as it just so happens, **steadily getting reviews over time makes a strong impact on how Google ranks you!**
Furthermore, as you expand into obtaining reviews on other sites, your rankings will benefit from the importance that Google places on your company receiving reviews on multiple platforms. In fact, when someone searches your company on Google, **many of the websites that you have ratings on will be shown in the results with stars**.
By following the strategy of reaching out to your clients and providing them with a couple of direct links, placing the primary focus on Google and Facebook initially, then expanding your review platform options to include home service and directory websites, and consistently earning new reviews, you will see tangible results. **We know this strategy works because we have executed this approach** countless times for our clients.
One final nugget that is important is the fact that, even though you initially want to focus your efforts on obtaining reviews from clients you know like your work, , unless you have a “convincing negative reputation”, as stated by Google in their . In this document, they also state that negative reviews are “completely normal and expected”.
Follow the review building strategy we have offered and feel free to share with us the results that you observe.

Around 3.5 billion Google searches are performed every day, as people are using the Internet more and more to look for potential restaurants, hotels, hair salons, and lawn care/landscaping services. **It's more important than ever to have an active Internet presence** in order to not only have a successful business but also to grow that business.
The first key element in having an active Internet presence for green industry businesses is to have a website that is properly designed. That proper website design has many different parts that make it work well and perform on search engines. **Learn about web design and why your green industry business needs it.**
Web design **centers around creating a website for your green industry business** that lives on the Internet. The website is a collection of pages with text, words, and images that outline your business and take a deep dive into the services your company offers, whether that be lawn care, landscaping, custom hardscaping, irrigation, or more.
Basically, —a virtual brochure that potential clients can browse through and view examples of your work while learning more about your company.
Imagine the outside of a business that looks unkempt. Would you immediately judge the business by how its exterior looks? More than likely, you would—especially as a lawn care professional. It's the same with your company website. More often than not, **your website is the first thing that potential customers will see.** If they access your site and see sloppy design, misspellings, inaccuracies, and more, they are less likely to choose to do business with you.
**When your website is professionally done, looks timely, and represents your business well,** customers will be more impressed and consider using your services over a competitor. Having good, solid web design is key to the success of your business. A website represents your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and **you want to ensure anything or anyone representing your company is constantly giving off a good impression.**
Other reasons your green industry company needs web design include:
  * It allows , what you do, and where you do it
  * It allows you to in photo galleries or project case studies
  * It gives you a chance to directly from the internet


In order to generate new, unique content specifically tailored to your company, optimize your photos for search engines, and more, it can take Lawnline Marketing up to 4-5 weeks or more depending on how many services are offered. Other web designers could take more or less time depending on their website build process.
When considering a new website, just remember this: **your website should end up making you money. It's an investment, not a cost.**
## Are you ready to create a website for your green industry business?
At Lawnline Marketing, we have green industry clients across the country who constantly see new leads coming in through the websites and other services we offer for them. We'd love to discuss marketing strategies with you. Give us a call at or submit an online form and one of our team members will get back to you about your website!

When lawn and landscaping companies are trying to increase their customer base or leads on a new job, it can be tough to figure out . In this day and age, many people are using the internet to find new companies and learn about them. If your business is not ranking high on search engines such as Google and Bing, it will be much harder for potential customers to find you.
**Increasing your ranking involves a practice called search engine optimization**(SEO), which is a multi-tiered process affected by several factors. SEO works very well for lawn care and landscaping services, and here's why.
## What Exactly Is Search Engine Optimization & Why Your Company Needs It
Simply put, **SEO is the art of getting your website ranked organically on search engines.** It is a collection of services combined of on-site and off-site services. In this case, organic means that visitors to your site found you via Google or Bing instead of being directed there through paid advertising. When leads are generated through organic traffic, the quality of those leads will generally be higher.
SEO generates the most leads for your company, as a majority of people click on Google organic search results.
## How Proper Search Engine Optimization for Lawn & Landscape Companies Happens

The site is built in a way that targets keywords and geographical locations that our clients want to rank for, such as "lawn mowing Portland, OR" or "hardscaping services Fort Collins, CO".
After a client site is launched, we . We also , which are business listings around the internet on sites such as Angie's List, Manta, and more.
Another **big part of online presence is the Google My Business listing** , which shows your business location, website, phone number, business hours, and more. We create, update, and .
We also with your page audience through content promotion. Building up your reviews on the sites that matter such as Google and Facebook also contributes to your SEO. Google takes these reviews into account when creating rankings for keywords.
On top of all that, so that we can identify opportunities for inbound links and keywords that your competitors are ranking for. When we find these opportunities, we can work to target those keywords as well. We that track your site's position and placements as well.
**There is no set amount of time for how long it takes SEO to happen.** It depends on many different factors, which include:
To display in the maps on a search results page, it relies on your proximity and your prominence—in other words, how close you are and how well you are known in the online world. **Based on our experience, this is about how long SEO can take:**


It is important to note that these estimates are for a brand-new online presence, not a site redesign. If your company already has an online presence, then the amount of time will depend on your existing presence.

Around 3.5 billion Google searches are performed every day, as people are using the Internet more and more to look for potential restaurants, hotels, hair salons, and lawn care/landscaping services. **It's more important than ever to have an active Internet presence** in order to not only have a successful business but also to grow that business.
The first key element in having an active Internet presence for green industry businesses is to have a website that is properly designed. That proper website design has many different parts that make it work well and perform on search engines. **Learn about web design and why your green industry business needs it.**
Web design **centers around creating a website for your green industry business** that lives on the Internet. The website is a collection of pages with text, words, and images that outline your business and take a deep dive into the services your company offers, whether that be lawn care, landscaping, custom hardscaping, irrigation, or more.
Basically, —a virtual brochure that potential clients can browse through and view examples of your work while learning more about your company.
Imagine the outside of a business that looks unkempt. Would you immediately judge the business by how its exterior looks? More than likely, you would—especially as a lawn care professional. It's the same with your company website. More often than not, **your website is the first thing that potential customers will see.** If they access your site and see sloppy design, misspellings, inaccuracies, and more, they are less likely to choose to do business with you.
**When your website is professionally done, looks timely, and represents your business well,** customers will be more impressed and consider using your services over a competitor. Having good, solid web design is key to the success of your business. A website represents your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and **you want to ensure anything or anyone representing your company is constantly giving off a good impression.**
Other reasons your green industry company needs web design include:
  * It allows , what you do, and where you do it
  * It allows you to in photo galleries or project case studies
  * It gives you a chance to directly from the internet


In order to generate new, unique content specifically tailored to your company, optimize your photos for search engines, and more, it can take Lawnline Marketing up to 4-5 weeks or more depending on how many services are offered. Other web designers could take more or less time depending on their website build process.
When considering a new website, just remember this: **your website should end up making you money. It's an investment, not a cost.**
## Are you ready to create a website for your green industry business?

Around 3.5 billion Google searches are performed every day, as people are using the Internet more and more to look for potential restaurants, hotels, hair salons, and lawn care/landscaping services. **It's more important than ever to have an active Internet presence** in order to not only have a successful business but also to grow that business.
The first key element in having an active Internet presence for green industry businesses is to have a website that is properly designed. That proper website design has many different parts that make it work well and perform on search engines. **Learn about web design and why your green industry business needs it.**
Web design **centers around creating a website for your green industry business** that lives on the Internet. The website is a collection of pages with text, words, and images that outline your business and take a deep dive into the services your company offers, whether that be lawn care, landscaping, custom hardscaping, irrigation, or more.
Basically, —a virtual brochure that potential clients can browse through and view examples of your work while learning more about your company.
Imagine the outside of a business that looks unkempt. Would you immediately judge the business by how its exterior looks? More than likely, you would—especially as a lawn care professional. It's the same with your company website. More often than not, **your website is the first thing that potential customers will see.** If they access your site and see sloppy design, misspellings, inaccuracies, and more, they are less likely to choose to do business with you.
**When your website is professionally done, looks timely, and represents your business well,** customers will be more impressed and consider using your services over a competitor. Having good, solid web design is key to the success of your business. A website represents your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and **you want to ensure anything or anyone representing your company is constantly giving off a good impression.**
Other reasons your green industry company needs web design include:
  * It allows , what you do, and where you do it
  * It allows you to in photo galleries or project case studies
  * It gives you a chance to directly from the internet


In order to generate new, unique content specifically tailored to your company, optimize your photos for search engines, and more, it can take Lawnline Marketing up to 4-5 weeks or more depending on how many services are offered. Other web designers could take more or less time depending on their website build process.
When considering a new website, just remember this: **your website should end up making you money. It's an investment, not a cost.**

## Page: https://lawnline.marketing/blog/case-study-jc-lawn-care

I'm Tony Ricketts, founder of Lawnline Websites. This is an inside look from my perspective on how J&C Lawn Care in Portland, Oregon is growing their lawn care and maintenance business using the Internet. In this case study, I'll outline their initial steps on the Internet, how they've grown into various channels, our role in their growth, where they currently stand today, as of August 21st, 2018, and what I hope to see in the future.
## It all started with a DIY website trial in October 2017.
Here at Lawnline Websites, we used to offer a do-it-yourself (DIY) website system allowing those who don't have the budget to hire our team to create a professional online presence. On October 9th, 2017, we received a notification of a new DIY website setup from Jesus Lemus. He and his good friend Chace were starting a lawn care company called J&C Lawn Care out of Portland. I didn't think much of it as we usually have at least 1-2 new DIY signups per day.
However, J&C quickly stood out to me. One reason was even though they had 2 weeks to try the website for free, they decided the same day they were ready to commit and converted to a paid account. After they made a few adjustments to the website, Jesus reached out for help putting the website live. Of course, we helped, and the new website went live with mostly default content and standard SEO was done automatically by our setup wizard software.
During this time, I personally spoke to Jesus and recommended they hire our team to build their website, especially if they are trying to bring in new customers. At the time, Jesus said they were just starting out and couldn't afford it. I could tell he was young, genuine, and had the drive to build a real business for the long-term. So, I offered a payment plan and told them it would be on the table if they ever decided to move to the next level.
## 5 months later, J&C Lawn Care took me up on my offer to finance their website build.
About 5 months later on February 28th, 2018, I received a call from Jesus that they really needed to get customers and wanted to take the offer to finance the website build. At this point, their DIY website had generated only 3 form submissions leads (granted it was only live through the end of fall and winter months). Of course, I honored the offer and started my team on building their website.
As we built their new website, we kept in mind the geographic area. Being that the Portland, OR area was large and highly competitive, we focused on certain suburbs and the east side of Portland in general with our on-page SEO efforts. As with any website, we handled all of the coding, content writing, imagery, and optimization.
On April 2nd, 2018, we completed the website and was ready for their review. About 6 days later, they sent a list of adjustments they would like to see and we implemented them right away. The was launched live on April 10th, 2018, just in time for the spring rush.
## It's the spring rush and a new website, but organic SEO takes time, that's why I recommended Google Ads and Facebook Ads.
**With the new website being launched in April, there was no way for the on-site SEO to improve their rankings fast enough to see an ROI during the spring rush that was currently going on.** Of course, I advised them of this from the beginning and offered another solution - paid advertising with Google. Being a start-up, unfortunately, they didn't have the funds for this.
I went over projected results with Jesus based on our numerous other Google campaigns we were already running for other companies. I advised J&C to save a couple thousand dollars as quickly as they could and to trust I will get them a great ROI. I was confident with this statement because we were doing it over and over again for many other clients.
After just a month, they reached back out around the 1st of May and said they were ready to try the advertising. If I remember right, they decided to finance the advertising on a credit card. At this point, they had put all of their faith in us (I definitely felt some pressure to deliver!). Knowing the advertising returns on this industry, I recommended we focus on the remaining yard cleanup customers to get an immediate ROI, but also lawn care, lawn mowing, and lawn service for the long-term. Because I really wanted to help them grow, I recommended sending part of the budget to Facebook, and that I would discount our fees, allowing them to afford the additional advertising channel.
It took us about a week to get the landing pages setup and the ads on both Google and Facebook configured. We didn't have much of a budget to work with, so proper segregation with strong landing pages was critical to the success. Here is an example of one of their landing pages: 
On Google, we straight killed it. From May through today (August 21st), we only , giving us an overall and $36.12 per lead. Of those 52 leads, 11 were higher priced yard cleanups. J&C Lawn Care closed enough yard cleanups in just the first week to pay for everything they have spent to date on both Google and Facebook Ads. Here is a screenshot from their Google Ads account as of this writing.
On Facebook, it is a little more difficult to report the exact number of leads because we can only track form submissions. Using the same ratio of calls to form submissions that Google produced (78% calls and 22% form submissions), the Facebook Ads have produced roughly to date. This gives their Facebook Ads a cost of 
## Our advertising services exploded their growth and revenue. Now they're re-investing with organic SEO efforts.
Now, it's toward the end of August, our advertising services multiplied their revenue, but it's not time to stop. Taking my advice, Jesus and Chace have decided to re-invest their profits into not only continuing the advertising, but adding on organic search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. Based on their current monthly budget, their organic SEO strategy includes:


**We started the organic SEO strategy earlier this month and are already seeing results.** If you head over to Google and search competitive terms like "" or "", you'll see J&C listed on the first page. To get these fast results, we went through the website with a fine-tooth comb and addressed every geo signal, started adding new content right away, and created engagement with their business.
As they continue to grow and their organic SEO budget grows, we'll incorporate additional aspects including review building, citations, additional social media platforms, video marketing, and more!
## The online strategy for J&C Lawn Care through the fall, winter, and next spring.
Here is what the near future holds for Jesus and Chace in regards to their company's online presence:
  * Update paid advertising to target aeration, fall cleanups, and fert/weed. Utilize monthly email newsletters to upsell these services and content marketing to bring more organic awareness.
  * Adjust paid advertising to only focus on yard cleanups, but mostly for distressed and overgrown properties. Continue content creation and email newsletters targeted toward general lawn/landscape care to increase domain authority in preparation for the spring rush.
  * We're bringing it all during the spring rush. We'll be doing search ads for lawn care, maintenance, cleanups, and more. We'll also be introducing affinity/intent ads. Then, we'll be pushing Facebook hard, combined with more organic and email marketing. I seriously feel bad for the other lawn care companies on the east-side of Portland because J&C will dominate the Internet in Spring 2019.


Believe it or not, working with companies like J&C gives me far more satisfaction than working with the big guys. Sure, we have clients with $300k/year marketing budgets, but those clients are easy. With the big guys, we have all the resources we need and the talent to dominate. With a company like J&C, they don't have a huge budget and we have to get creative, challenging our team to become better and further perfect our abilities.
However, the biggest reason I get more personal gratification working with really small companies is that guys like Jesus and Chace appreciate it more, and I feel like I've played a major role in their success. If these guys continue down their current path, I believe they will be one of the biggest lawn care companies in the Portland area within 5 years.
