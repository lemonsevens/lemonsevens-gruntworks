  * : Utilizing tools to track interactions, manage leads, and streamline communication.

Sales enablement empowers sales teams by providing them with the tools, resources, and information they need to engage effectively with prospects. This support results in faster lead response times, improved close rates, and increased confidence when handling objections or questions. Ultimately, it enhances team productivity and helps achieve revenue targets more efficiently.
Sales content is essential to sales enablement, as it provides sales reps with resources that help engage and educate prospects. Content such as case studies, product guides, FAQ sheets, and presentation decks supports reps in guiding prospects through the buying journey, addressing concerns, and showcasing the value of your services.
Sales enablement is crucial because it aligns the sales team with the tools, training, and content needed to work more effectively. By enabling sales reps to respond quickly and accurately to customer needs, sales enablement improves conversion rates, shortens sales cycles, and drives revenue growth, making it a vital component of a successful sales strategy.
How do you measure the effectiveness of a sales enablement program?
The effectiveness of a sales enablement program is measured by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  *   * : Percentage of leads that convert at each stage of the sales funnel.
  * : How often sales reps use the provided content and its impact on engagement.
  *   * 

Regular analysis of these KPIs allows for ongoing optimization of the program.
What are some common challenges in implementing a sales program?
  * : Ensuring alignment between sales and marketing on goals and messaging.
  * : Managing and organizing content so that sales reps can easily access relevant materials.
  * : Encouraging the team to adopt new tools, such as CRM systems, to streamline processes.
  * : Providing ongoing training and coaching rather than one-time sessions.
  * : Establishing clear metrics to track the effectiveness and impact of the enablement program.


Technology plays a critical role in sales enablement by providing tools like:
  * : Organizing and sharing sales materials in one accessible location.
  * : Using email automation to keep leads engaged throughout the buying journey. By leveraging these technologies, sales teams can work more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and have easy access to the resources they need.

# Appropriate Marketing for Your Business Stage & Top Challenges You’re Having With Digital Marketing.
Hire the marketing agency who cares like an owner and creates lasting results.
## The Right Marketing & Budget for the Stage of Your Business
We identify the stage of your business (where you are) Discuss your sales and revenue goals (where you want to go) Develop the appropriate plan and budget to get to the next level.
  * Fundamentals need a solid website education, Need lead flow going
  * I’m trying to educate myself, not able to afford a lot, what should I do to build the best foundation


Marketing beyond referrals and service delivery are the top priorities for these businesses.
They are typically run by an owner who really knows how to work their personal network and has built a team around them. Toward the high end of this stage it is easy for these owners to think they’ve ‘made it’.
This owner needs to have at least one key person in their business who helps start to grow marketing capabilities, but finding an who helps focus mostly on volume lead generation is critical. This helps this business grow beyond the $1M annual revenue mark.
Making sure you have the right people on the team and marketing and sales systems are the top priorities for these businesses.
The owner has usually found a small leadership team for their company and starts to hand responsibility to these ‘department’ leaders – marketing, sales, service delivery, billing/finance.
From a marketing perspective, lead generation is still important, but now moving beyond the owner as the lead sales person means systems and processes need to be in place for bringing on sales talent.
These systems also need to measure everything that is going on in marketing and sales.
Toward the high end of this stage most owners start to be able to ‘think bigger’ and if successful can step outside the business and work on it, but still in it as well.
A , for example, can help keep marketing costs lower as growth occurs.
Defining the company’s culture, hiring and running omni-channel marketing campaigns are the top priorities for these businesses.
The owner has reached a level where they are now very clear on their vision and how department leaders’ goals are to help achieve that vision – marketing, sales, service delivery, billing/finance.
From a marketing perspective, lead generation is still important, but now 
A fractional CMO can help provide this guidance and is a partner to the Sales Manager.
During this phase, typically at about $4M to $5M in annual revenues, a Marketing Manager is also hired to help support the CMO.
The CRM that was set up in the 7 Figure stage is now used to track activity and results across all relevant channels.


The marketing at this stage is both external (for lead generation and sales enablement) and internal for culture development.




The timing of these business stages are not hard and fast rules, but should provide you with an indication of where your business is and what marketing challenges are around the next corner.

What is the difference between a website builder and custom web design?
is a platform with pre-designed templates that allow for quick setup but limited customization, typically best for small, simple sites. In contrast,  is a fully tailored approach that creates a unique website to fit your brand’s specific needs, functionality, and goals. Custom web design offers flexibility, scalability, and optimization that’s harder to achieve with basic builders.
The timeline for designing a website varies based on its complexity and requirements. For a typical business website, the process generally takes , including discovery, planning, design, development, and testing. Complex websites with custom features or integrations may take longer. At FANNIT, we work closely with clients to set realistic timelines and keep the process on track.
Website design is the process of creating the visual and functional aspects of a website, combining layout, graphics, colors, fonts, and user interface elements. It also encompasses usability and user experience (UX) principles to ensure that the website is intuitive, attractive, and aligned with the brand’s goals. Effective website design is essential for engaging users and driving conversions.
Accessibility ensures that a website is usable for people with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers or require alternative text and color contrasts. Accessible design makes your site inclusive, enhances user experience, and is often a legal requirement. It also improves SEO, as search engines favor sites with accessible, well-structured content.

# What is Email Marketing: Campaign Best Practices, Strategy, & Advertising Tips (How To)
Companies have been leveraging email marketing strategies for decades to connect, nurture, and convert leads into customers.
It’s one of the oldest ways to promote services online, but email marketing has remained a popular alternative for a reason. Emails are the simplest and most direct form of communication you can have with your audience. But, they also give marketers the flexibility to design complex campaigns tailored for subscribers that have the potential to become paying clients.
Although emails can be a great way to connect with potential customers, it’s important to understand the nuances that come with this type of campaign. Developing sales emails is different from crafting SEO-friendly content or PPC ads, so companies need to incorporate the right elements to succeed.
Fannit award-winning digital marketing agency that specializes in developing robust email campaigns. **Our team understands the importance of having superb content, so we’ve developed a unique approach to email marketing that produces stellar results for our customers**.
In this article, we’ll go over the definition of email marketing and highlight this strategy’s benefits. We’ll also discuss the best ways to increase the number of subscribers you have as well as other tips to launch a successful email campaign.
As the name suggests, email marketing is the practice of promoting a brand’s products and services through email.
But, even though it has a simple definition, there are dozens of different email marketing approaches you can take to attract more customers.
In an ideal scenario, a business collects email addresses from its prospect when they visit the business’ website.
Then, the marketing team can send out a sequence of marketing emails that promote the business’ branding as well as its solutions. The sequences are also designed to move prospects down the sales funnel, transform them into leads, and, finally, turn them into sales.

Well, that depends on the email marketing strategy you implement.
But, assuming the setup and technique chosen are appropriate for your business goals, the answer is a resounding yes.
Emails have become a part of everyday life for billions of consumers around the world.
That said, the average user receives hundreds of notifications per day, many of which are marketing emails.
This is the reason why marketers need to stay creative and test out fresh ideas to ensure their campaigns attain the level of success they envisioned.
It’s among the most cost-effective approaches, so companies don’t need to make huge investments to see good results.
In addition to this, some of the best benefits of email marketing include:
According to recent estimates, there are around the world.
Moreover, the average professional checks his or her emails , which is equivalent to logging in every 37 minutes.
In other words, emails are the easiest way for companies to communicate with their audiences without disrupting their routine.
Although emails may be seen as obsolete by some marketers, this form of communication can help you connect with customers at the right time.
Sending out a marketing email at a crucial moment during the decision-making process can be the difference between getting a new customer or losing a lead.
And, given that 60% of emails are opened on mobile devices, it’s safe to assume that this approach allows you to reach potential customers regardless of the device they prefer.
One of the biggest benefits of launching email marketing campaigns is that they give you maximum control over your promotional plan.
Companies can run branding, lead generation, and other types of campaigns and develop virtually any type of content. You can opt to promote your blog posts, services, business values, and other elements that give you a better image and improve your chances of converting prospects into customers.
Additionally, companies that launch email campaigns don’t rely on additional platforms for support because they own the database of prospects.
Unlike PPC ads and similar approaches, email marketing gives marketers the ability to manage every part of their campaigns.
Sure, there are different tools to help you get started building lists and acquire more email subscribers, but these tools are normally under your full control.
As we mentioned earlier, email marketing is relatively affordable, so companies don’t need to make huge investments to set up a successful campaign.
With this in mind, this strategy can help you raise awareness about a new product, boost the performance of your content marketing activities, and increase the number of sales you generate.
Generating more revenue through a small investment results in a higher ROI, which allows you to allocate more resources to growing your business.
According to some estimates, the ROI of email marketing campaigns is higher than PPC, social media marketing, and SEO, which is the reason use this technique to nurture leads.
Now that we’ve discussed the definition of email marketing and its benefits, it’s time to go over the steps you need to take to develop a successful campaign.
This article covers a variety of email marketing best practices, but in this section we’ll go over a quick outline of the different stages.
All companies are different, so there is no exact set of instructions on how to do email marketing that works for all businesses.
You have to take a look at your requirements, budget, client base, and other variants in order to determine the best approach for your organization.
With the above in mind, the general stages that almost all companies go through are:
The key to succeeding with email advertising is to take an organized approach.
Before developing content or setting your plan in stone, you should create a set of goals and objectives to help measure the success of your campaign.
Focus on setting both short and long-term objectives, including small milestones that will help keep your work team on track.
For example, a good short-term goal would be to build up your email list of subscribers by a set number during the first month.
Milestones can include activities like the implementation of forms on your site and the development of content that’s designed to attract potential subscribers.
As for long-term goals, you should stick to goals that can be measured, but think in terms of 3 to 12 months down the line.
How many leads do you want to generate during this time frame? What elements will you add to your marketing mix? When should you release these materials? All these are questions that should be answered at this point.
But, remember to be realistic with your estimates, otherwise you’ll be setting yourself up for failure.
As with most other promotion strategies, you need to learn more about your audience before you begin crafting your marketing emails.
Effective email marketing strategies capture customers’ attention and use valuable content to keep them engaged.
However, the only way to produce content that your potential subscribers deem as useful is to understand their pain points and develop materials that help solve these challenges.
Fortunately, learning about your audience is much easier than a few decades ago.
Today, companies can rely on a variety of tools to help them understand consumer trends that are currently shaping their industries.
Furthermore, organizations should look at their current base of customers and subscribers to determine what factors encouraged them to purchase or subscribe to your email newsletter.
By reverse-engineering knowledge based on your current customers, you’ll develop great email campaigns that reel in more subscribers and have higher open rates.
Once you’ve set your objectives and gained in-depth knowledge about your audience, it’s time to create a tailored campaign for your business.
Developing an email strategy is more complex than figuring out what emails to send when.
For starters, you should look at your set of goals and your budget. The first steps usually include implementing features that help capture email address and other pieces of information from online users.
So, determine which basic changes are the most important, calculate their cost, and create a timeline based on the funds you have available.
Use the same technique for all steps until you create a blueprint of your plan.
After outlining your entire email marketing strategy, start thinking about the content you’ll create.
If possible, you should review your previous email analytics and website statistics to find out which content is performing best.
Then, establish a schedule for developing these materials, creating a sequence, and writing out the emails for each stage.
Getting help from an email marketing specialist can help simplify the process and allow you to focus on delivering the best service to your customers.
Now that we’ve examined why email marketing is important, let’s look at the benefits of choosing the right platform to manage your campaign.
There are dozens of different email service providers out there, so choosing the best options is not always easy.
As a general rule of thumb, you’ll want to choose a platform that allows you to send targeted emails, create visually-appealing messages that yield a high click-through-rate, and allows marketing automation.
It’s important to note that some platforms offer unique features, but you should ideally find an email service that has all the basics before looking at these details.
We’ll go over the top platforms to create email campaigns later on in this article, but it’s important to understand that the combination of tools you choose will directly affect the results you get.
You should take the time and research the different options for each activity you need to carry out, from form building right down to content creation and integrations with your other tools.
Every successful online email marketing campaign relies on an effective sequence of messages that gently move subscribers down the sales funnel.
But, to develop these sequences, you need to have an in-depth understanding of the buyer’s journey.
The buyer’s journey represents the different steps that the average prospect follows before becoming a customer.
That said, you may have more than one stereotypical customer, which means that you have to develop tailored sequences for each segment of your audience.
You should already have a good understanding of the buyer’s journey from the customer research stage. If you don’t have enough information, you can always develop a few variations and conduct split testing to see which variants give you the best results.
Depending on the features you have on your website, you may already have an email list to start with.
If this is the case, you’ll need to focus on updating your current email list and growing the number of subscribers you currently have.
Some companies may not have the luxury of starting with an email list, so they’ll need to develop a plan to attract potential customers.
In the vast majority of cases, consumers are happy to exchange their email address for information they deem as valuable. Once again, knowing your audience is crucial, but you also have to watch the quality of the content you release.
If the quality of your lead generation content is questionable, you won’t be able to build an effective email marketing campaign.
There are different types of content you’ll need to create for your business’ email campaign.
Email newsletters are a must, but you’ll also have to promote your blog posts, pages, and other content on your website.
The good news is that email marketing plays well with other techniques. For example, if you already have an inbound marketing plan in place, you can promote this content through email to boost the performance of your entire digital promotion efforts.
With the above in mind, you’ll also have to develop tailored content to move each segment of your audience down the funnel.
First off, you should determine which materials should be sent to customers in which stage.
Subscribers in the early stages of the funnel respond well to blogs, tutorials, and lighter content.
Potential customers that are further down the sales funnel prefer more comprehensive pieces like ebooks, white papers, and case studies.
When you have a good idea of what content is suitable for which stage, you should write the email sequences that will help transform subscribers into paying customers.
There’s a good chance your subscribers will open your emails mobile devices, so you may need to make some adjustments to your content.
You won’t necessarily have to write new content, but you’ll want to ensure your website and marketing materials can be viewed comfortably by people with mobile devices
Even if you feel like you built an effective email marketing plan, take the time to complete the last checks and review the whole strategy one last time.
Verify that the sequence you create makes sense and that your content has been proofed and is ready to go.
Also, remember to test the email address forms on your website to ensure they’re saving the data on your email list.
Take this opportunity to test the different integrations you put in place and make sure that all of them are working properly. The last thing you need is for subscribers to leave their data and for it not to get transferred to your email list.
After reviewing your campaign, you can hit the launch button and send out the first wave of email newsletters and other targeted emails.
Email marketing has evolved into a complex art form, so blasting subscribers with wave after wave of promotional emails won’t do the trick anymore.
Modern consumers are savvy and they have access to email providers that filter out promotional materials based on the subject line and other elements. Even if your emails have a high open rate, you need to ensure that potential customers are following the right steps after.
Like other forms of online techniques, email marketing allows you to monitor and adjust your campaign based on the results you get.
Remember, your email campaigns are composed of a variety of different parts, so you’ll need to keep a close eye on a set of key statistics that give you valuable insights.
You should always measure your emails’ click-through-rate, but also take the time to determine which other metrics hold the most value for your business.
Then, track these statistics and make tweaks to continuously improve the performance of your marketing materials.
There are many factors that will affect the performance of your email campaign, but growing your list may be the most important part of this marketing strategy.
Sure, the subject line, content, and website you redirect subscribers to will have an impact on the results you get. But, you will never be able to generate enough income from your email marketing if you don’t have a large number of subscribers.
You may run into companies that sell email address lists that are supposed to help you get started.
In our experience, these lists don’t generate positive results, even if they claim to be ultra-relevant to your audience. Avoid buying lists from third parties and focus those resources on creating a comprehensive email campaign instead.
Below, we’ve put together a few email marketing tips to help you build your list of subscribers.
In order to create a larger email list, you’ll need to lure subscribers with great content.
Remember, consumers know how to differentiate between functional and superficial content, so you’ll need to produce materials that convince each user to leave his or her email address.
Creating a lead magnet is a great way to collect emails for your marketing campaigns.
In simple terms, a lead magnet is a piece of super-valuable content you exchange for a user’s email address. Lead magnets don’t have to be expensive or complex, you simply have to offer something that your audience deems useful.
Some of the digital materials you can provide include PDFs, MP3 files, or any other type of content your audience likes to consume.
At this stage you shouldn’t worry about open rates or the subject line you’ll use on each message, simply create something that will help you build your email list.
To get access to your content, potential customers have to provide their email address, which already represents an obstacle in their eyes.
Make sure you simplify the process and develop an easy downloading flow. This will help encourage visitors to become subscribers and ensure that your potential customers get access to the content they need.
The average consumers’ reading skills are relatively basic, so you should also make your content easy to read.
This may vary from one industry to the next, so you have to determine the best writing level for your audience based on the results you get. But, you also have to ensure your content still delivers in terms of quality.
You can use online tools to check the level of the content you write or partner with a firm that specializes in targeted email campaigns.
Although it still delivers amazing results, marketing emailing is a common practice in almost all industries.
To stand out, your business has to develop content that’s packed with actionable information.
In most cases, offering long-form content is a great idea because it provides enough space to address your customers’ biggest challenges.
White papers, ebooks, and case studies are the perfect types of content to use as a lead magnet because they can be downloaded and as comprehensive as you want.
That said, you have to know what challenges customers face in order to create a piece of content that works as a solution. You should compile statistics from reputable sources or conduct your own research and highlight the practical data that your subscribers can put in place.
Like all other people, your potential customers are constantly seeking for immediate rewards.
While some companies tend to announce their lead magnets before they’re available, this can cause them to lose some of the hype built by their promotional materials.
In our experience, the best method is to make lead magnets immediately available to customers
Potential subscribers are already facing an issue by the time they’re researching different solutions.
In most cases, these users want to find an immediate solution, so making them wait to get access may not create the right effect.
It’s worth noting that this varies depending on the industry.
For example, if your business serves an industry that’s always looking for improvements, like online streaming, you may benefit from promoting your lead magnet before it’s rolled out.
The forms on your site will help you capture each user’s email address as well as other crucial pieces of information that you’ll use during the optimization process.
Your form should have two different purposes, which are to collect contact information and to get email newsletter subscribers.
Think about your opt-in form as a smaller version of your website.
After all, it has a similar goal, which is to convince potential customers to take a specific step. And, like your website, your subscribers will evaluate a variety of different elements when determining whether to fill out your forms or to pass on the opportunity.
Not all forms are the same, so you need to pay attention to the design, placement, and other variables to try to find the best combination.
In our experience, some of the qualities shared by successful forms include:
To some, forms on a website may all look the same. But there’s actually an almost infinite variety of design elements you can add to the forms on your website.
Each audience is different, so you’ll need to understand the elements that our potential customers find attractive in order to know which variables to implement.
Although the form should be noticeable, it should not stand out in a negative way so it should follow a similar design to your website.
Furthermore, you need to ensure that the font, contrast, and other basic elements follow sound practices. This will result in a clear form that instills confidence in customers and encourages them to leave their email addresses.
Having a convenient form will increase the number of subscribers you get, so don’t bother creating complex forms that require too much information.
While this can be a good strategy in a handful of industries, you should keep the number of fields on your form to a minimum and only request, first name, last name, and email address.
Modern consumers are privacy conscious, so asking customers to leave too many details can have a negative effect on your conversions.
Make sure that your form has a link to the terms of use for your download and also request user consent before signing them up for your newsletter.
#### Highlight the Benefits of the Content and Have at Least One Call-to-Action
It’s true that the opt-in forms don’t have that much space, but you should highlight the benefits of the content to reinforce customers’ decision to download your lead magnet.
Some companies have started including space for a few bullet points as part of their form design, which allows them to mention a few benefits during the fill out process.
Having at least one call to action can also increase the number of subscribers you generate through your downloadable content.
In opt-in forms, calls to action are usually buttons that people have to click on to complete the subscription process. These buttons often have a small text that tells subscribers what to do, for example, “click here to download your guide” or something along those lines.
Customers view your website as your online storefront, so you should leverage this channel and try to drive more traffic through different strategies.
Before you start sending more visitors to your website, analyze your most important pages and make sure that all your forms are working.
You should also verify that your servers are equipped to handle a boost in traffic and that your marketing team is prepared for an increase in subscribers.
Once everything is set, you can turn to social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and other techniques to generate more subscribers from your lead magnet.
Search engine optimization is a marketing strategy that focuses on driving traffic to your website through organic or unpaid means. The main goal of this approach is to increase your website’s rankings on Google and other search engines.
This, in turn, results in a higher number of potential customers visiting your site, which should help you collect more leads.
There are dozens of different elements that affect your website’s SEO rankings, so you need to develop a separate strategy to increase the number of organic visitors you receive. With this in mind, SEO is among the most affordable forms of online marketing and it can help you build a great reputation and grow your email list at the same time.
Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a form of paid marketing that allows you to place ads throughout a variety of platforms.
Google Ads, the most reputable ad network out there, lets companies place paid ads on its search results, which can also exponentially boost the number of visitors you get on a daily basis.
However, PPC is not as affordable as SEO because you have to pay for every click generated.
It’s still more cost-effective than traditional forms of advertising and the best part is that it provides results right away. If you choose to invest in a PPC campaign, you’ll probably have a much bigger email list by the time you launch your campaign.
Especially if you compliment it with good social media marketing.
Social media has become an essential part of our identity as humans.
For businesses, social media networks went from publishing platforms to reliable sources of potential customers, so you can turn to Facebook and other channels to help you get more customer emails.
As with search engines, you can choose to run an organic or unpaid social media campaign.
Paid social media campaigns tend to be more affordable than traditional PPC, plus these platforms give you more targeting settings due to the amount of information customers willingly provide. While this may not affect your emails’ open rate, social media users tend to be more engaged, plus your business will have more credibility if you have a solid social presence.
We mentioned earlier that there are dozens of quality email marketing platforms to choose from, so finding the ideal fit may require some research.
Like with the rest of your strategy, you’ll have to analyze your requirements and find a set of tools that give you the ability to create as well as manage multiple email marketing campaigns at the same time.
At Fannit, we’ve worked with a variety of different tools, but we found that the best email marketing tools are the most comprehensive options.
These can often integrate easily into your entire digital promotion plan and help you get started without much hassle.
Below are our top three picks for the best email marketing available for companies today.
If you’ve researched email marketing platforms before, you’ve likely heard of MailChimp.
This powerful tool offers a simple interface that’s packed with great features ideal for starters and experienced marketers alike.
It offers integrations with just about every other email marketing tool available, plus it has a free plan if you want to test the waters and start paying once you see results.
Through MailChimp, you can create sales introduction email templates, develop an engaging subject line for each message in your sequence, and run different tests to find the best combinations. However, you’ll have to sign up for one of their paid plans if you want to have access to the platform’s fancier features.
For many companies Constant Contact is the best email marketing tool available because it has a robust infrastructure that’s suitable for campaigns of all sizes.
The platform allows you to create professional-looking emails through a drag-and-drop tool.
Plus, you can send out automated emails and track your campaign’s performance through one single platform.
Constant Contact is available for free for a limited period of time before you have to start paying for the tool.
It’s an excellent choice in terms of email campaign creation and management, but it still has a few limitations if you’re looking at your marketing strategy as a whole.
In our humble opinion, Hubspot is the best platform to manage email marketing campaigns.
The reason for this is that it doesn’t only allow you to manage email marketing campaigns, but it serves as a central hub for your inbound promotion plan.
Hubspot can help you create rich templates and email sequences, plus you can measure how well they’re performing through the platform’s in-house tracking system.
Incorporating an email strategy into Hubspot and your inbound plan will have a positive effect on all of your marketing activities because it will create a more holistic promotion machine.
If you’ve launched any type of promotional campaign before, you understand the importance of identifying the segments you want to target.
Client segments refer to the stereotypical groups that make up your customer base.
In other words, these are the different audiences that you’ll be sending emails to. And, they are important because different segments find different content elements engaging, so knowing about the different user groups will help you create better marketing materials.
Even if you want to broaden your reach, you should always start by creating different segments based on the email marketing analytics of your current client base.
These are the segments you are currently attracting and profiting from, so you should capitalize on these and slowly develop additional campaigns to attract other audiences.
Understanding why it’s important to create segments is one thing, but learning how to divide your client base takes a bit of practice.
For starters, you have to identify the similarities in customer behavior patterns and create different groups based on this information.
This process is similar to creating buyer personas, which are fictional representations of your ideal customers.
You should aim to include as much detail as possible, like age range, potential company titles, and other pieces of information you get from your current customers.
Some of the similarities you should look for during the segmentation process include:
The most basic way to categorize your segments is depending if they’re new or current subscribers.
New subscribers should receive a series of welcome emails before receiving the same materials as people who are already getting your newsletters and other marketing materials.
Depending on the complexity of your email marketing plan, the series of welcome emails can serve as a simple introduction or start moving people down the sales funnel right away.
Email campaigns designed to move prospects down the funnel immediately may include call to action buttons that trigger different email sequences depending on which ones people choose
Companies can also segment their email list based on people’s preferences and interests. In your contact form, you can include a small checkbox for customers who are interested in getting updates about your blog and similar content.
Then, you can divide your list based on which customers want to get information about your offers and people that want to hear about your new blog posts.
You can also use additional techniques to collect more information about your target audience and create other subgroups based on interests and preferences.
For example, flower shops can send out email surveys to find out which customers are interested in specific species, then create segments accordingly.
Companies that serve the local community can also segment their lists by location.
If your business serves and surrounding areas, you can segment users by city, like Edmonds, Redmond, Kirkland, Bellevue, and so on.
If the bulk of your sales come from cities around your area, you should focus on promoting your services to your local audience.
Email segmentation is a good start, but you should combine this strategy with local SEO and other techniques that help you connect with people in your immediate community.
The first few days after making the initial contact is crucial because subscribers are “warm,” which means they’ve recently engaged and are more likely to respond to your marketing emails.
As people’s activity levels begin to decline, they become “cold” and are less likely to interact with your materials.
Instead of blasting both user groups with the same emails, you should create an additional segment to people who haven’t reacted to your messages in a while. You can remind these users what steps you want them to take in order to re-enter your funnel while you gradually nurture the rest of your leads.
All effective email marketing strategies include open rate optimization, but this doesn’t mean that all of your potential customers will interact with your messages at the same level.
People that have higher open rates are easier to engage, so you may be able to move them down the funnel faster with more direct marketing.
The group of people that has a lower open rate will be harder to convince, but these users can still be converted.
You may have to play the long game on these, but be patient, stick to your strategy, and you’ll be able to transform them into sales.
Knowing where your leads came from can give you an advantage because you will understand what path they’re more likely to follow.
The people on your list that came in through search engines and other organic sources are likely looking for a solution, but they tend to follow traditional buyer journeys.
Social media leads, on the other hand, tend to have better engagement metrics.
While an aggressive tactic may not pay off, being casual and taking a lighter tone can yield stellar results.
Keep in mind that segmentation doesn’t have to occur at one exact stage.
If your prospects almost always follow the same path until they enter the bottom of the funnel, you can start segmenting your list in this phase.
For ecommerce companies and other businesses that offer shopping abilities online, segmenting their list by shopping card status can yield a higher number of conversions.
Just remember, people who added items and abandoned the website without attempting to check out should have a different sequence from prospects that changed their mind on the payment screen.
The first hurdles that you’ll have to overcome are building your email list and getting people’s permission to send them regular updates.
But, this doesn’t mean that it’s smooth sailing after that. Unfortunately, spam filters are among the biggest challenges that your emails will face before making it to your customers.
Below, we’ve put together a list of tips to help you overcome some of the most common challenges you will face.
How often should you send marketing emails? Is there such a thing as sending too many sales emails? What happens if you send too many emails too regularly? There is no exact formula to know the perfect frequency, so you’ll have to look at your company and figure out which is the best combination.
But, one thing we know for sure is that blasting your subscribers with low quality emails will likely get you tagged as spam.
Spam filters work automatically, so they rely on a set of rules (and artificial-intelligence in super-fancy platforms) in order to categorize all incoming mail.
The goods news is that there are different steps you can take to reduce the chances of being sent to the spam file, where your emails will never be seen by your target.


If you’re thinking about email marketing ideas, removing users from your list is probably not the first thing to come to mind.
But, the only way to maintain a fresh list that accurately represents your customers, you need to eliminate people who are not interacting with your emails anymore.
After you segment it, your email list will help you take a variety of marketing decisions.
However, if many of the users on your list are not active anymore, you should remove them in order to keep your list up to date.
Leaving inactive subscribers will skew your analytics data and likely send you down the wrong path.
### Study the Buyer’s Journey to Deliver Content with Better Timing
One of the worst ideas we constantly see in beginner campaigns is to use email to promote a gimmick.
Not only is this type of marketing obsolete, but modern consumers may actually take offense to it.
Instead, your potential customers would rather see you showcase the quality of your solutions and how these can be of use to them.
By studying the buyer’s journey, you’ll have a better idea of the challenges that prospects face at different stages of their decision-making process. This will help you create more engaging materials and send them out at crucial times, which will likely increase your open rates.
The vast majority of successful email campaigns employ engaging subject lines that work like hooks, capturing readers’ attention the moment they are viewed.
In the majority of cases, subject lines that spark curiosity, include statistics, and use a friendly tone tend to produce great results. This may vary from company to company, to run a few tests before choosing one specific style.
The subject lines you use will make or break your email marketing campaign, so speak your audience’s language and pay attention to the small details to increase your chances of success.
For consumers, there is nothing worse than companies that use email like an old-school billboard ad.
Instead of simply saying “hi” or addressing all of your customers, make sure to address each individual by the name they provided.
Everyone knows that you’re sending the same emails to hundreds of other users, but no one wants to feel like they are just a number.
Talk to one single person, use the subscriber’s name, and make them feel like they’re getting a message from a friend rather than getting materials that are clearly part of your email marketing plan.
It’s common to see companies using a casual tone in their marketing, especially in email.
We know that this isn’t necessarily a great approach for all companies, but you’d be surprised by how much consumers love to get casual emails from a company.
It makes them feel as if they’re speaking to a friend rather than a brand that’s promoting a product, which changes the entire interaction.
We believe that being casual (while still keeping it professional) is a great option for your email marketing strategy — as long as you can pull it off. And, if you’re in doubt, you can always run a few tests to gauge your audience’s sentiment.
Remember the no gimmick rule? Well, we’ll double down on that advice and strongly suggest you attempt to dazzle your audience with amazing content instead.
From the email design right down to the functionality of the content, you should use email to deliver value, which will gradually help you close more sales.
Although emails give you a lot of space to include content, having ultra-long emails doesn’t necessarily mean that users will read your content.
On the contrary, you should use your email marketing strategy to give readers a taste of your content and send them to your blogs, pages, and downloadables instead.
Injecting humor into your messages is also among the most common business email ideas.
But like casual tones, you need to ensure you can get away with it first.
B2B providers and companies in relatively orthodox industries have to test the water and implement little humor, if any at all.
However, some industries lend themselves to this technique, so it’s worth trying if you think your company can benefit. But, regardless of your specialty, always stick to more innocent humor and avoid anything that can be seen as offensive.
We’ve already covered the importance of general optimization, but you can create a process that allows you to improve open rates specifically.
Getting higher open rates should boost the performance of your campaign or allow you to see which is the biggest obstacle that steps prospects from moving down the funnel, so in either way you’ll get something good out of it.
We’ve finally gone over all the basics you need to understand in order to create a bigger list, design a campaign, and start to send your emails. But, there’s a variety of techniques you can employ to make the email campaign management process a lot simpler.
Email marketing automation is the process of automating various steps in your campaign.
The most common form of automation is auto-replying to people’s emails, but you can set up a system that automatically sends out sequences that are triggered by specific actions.
Here are the steps you need to take to implement email marketing automation.
There are dozens of email marketing automation tools out there, so you’ll have to find an option that has all the features your company needs.
Hubspot is the most comprehensive solution in terms of overall marketing strategy, but you may find other platforms that also work for your business.
Just make sure you choose a platform that allows you to create sequences that include attractive call to action buttons and other key elements.
Like your marketing plan, you should create a set of goals for your automation strategy.
You don’t have to settle for one either — you can create automation sequences to welcome people who recently subscribed, move them down the funnel, and to help with any other step you want them to take.
Even though the email sequence will be automated, you still have to create an outline of the order of each message.
This will give you a better idea of how logical and effective your marketing automation strategy will be. And, you can also figure out the best email subject lines for every message.
It doesn’t matter if you’re developing an email or text message strategy, before you start to send automated notifications, you also have to write the contents of each message.
People will react to your subject lines, but if the emails contain low-quality content, your prospects will lose interest in your materials.
In addition to the copy, also include links to the resources on your website and social media channels in case subscribers want to learn more information right away.
Remember, people won’t always take the steps you want them to when you send out an email.
If you notice a negative pattern developing, there’s no reason why you should stick to a strategy that’s not providing the right results.
If you notice your emails are not having the desired effect, change variables like the tone, subject line, and other content before you send it to people on your list.
Creating an email strategy that works and crafting an effective sequence takes a lot of time, but this technique can become a valuable source of leads for your company.
We hope that our email marketing guide helps you understand the different benefits of this approach and gives you the information you need to get started and send out engaging emails today.

Before we dive in, let’s make sure we have an understanding digital marketing is…
Also known as online, internet, or web marketing, this type of marketing focuses on promoting your solutions through internet-capable devices.
There are dozens of different digital marketing techniques you can opt for, but all of these are designed to target specific audiences who are using the internet at a certain stages within their journey to find a product or service you offer.
So, rather than using cookie-cutter strategies, companies need to understand how their prospective customers behave in order to choose the right messaging, in the right places, at the right time.
Check out our article on to learn more.
As we mentioned before, there are many different digital marketing strategies you can implement to promote your products.
With this in mind, it’s important to understand that most of these channels rely on similar assets, which means that you can create a set of resources per campaign and adjust these depending on where they will be placed.
Here are some of the most common digital assets that you can use to promote your product or service:


And of course, your website plays a double role, functioning as both an asset and a promotion channel in its own right.
There are many channels out there that allow your company to develop successful digital marketing campaigns.
Additionally, many of these are fully compatible and actually compliment each other, so a healthy digital marketing strategy should include a combination of tactics.
While there are many digital marketing strategies available already, new web platforms are constantly being developed.
A lot of these are industry niched. So stay tuned to the latest developments in the world of online promotion to increase your awareness of opportunities for your business’s market.
So, which are the best digital marketing tactics? That’s going to primarily depend on your industry and audience.
Just a few decades ago, video marketing in the form of television ads was the ultimate form of advertising. Today, consumers turn to the internet to find new products and services. Which makes online channels the best way to reach your audiences.
There are so many different digital marketing components that simply creating the right mix can be a challenging, time-consuming process.
This is why it’s necessary to have knowledge beyond digital marketing basics and leverage this profound understanding in the creation of your marketing strategy.
Note that there is no perfect formula to help you find the ideal marketing mix. Your digital marketing strategy should be tailored to your business’s specific needs. So, before choosing the digital channels you’ll use to drive website visitors, take the time to research your business and customer.
Only then will you be able to ensure a great experience from the moment your prospects’ online experiences begin to after they become customers.
It’s important to understand that the term “digital marketing” encompasses a wide range of techniques.
Each digital marketing tactic offers unique benefits, but you also need to create a plan for each one and make sure that it aligns with your main strategy.
Additionally, your target audience will probably employ smartphones and other mobile devices to conduct their searches.
Users behave differently on these devices, so you need to implement a separate mobile marketing strategy designed specifically for these individuals.
If you’re not sure what marketing channels to choose or where to start, you can work with a expert like FANNIT to hit the ground running.
All businesses are different, so you need to keep your goals and resources in mind when choosing the best online marketing tactics for your company.
Let’s take a look at some of the most popular internet marketing techniques available today:
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a type of organic digital marketing that’s extremely powerful for a variety of great reasons.
In a nutshell, SEO strategies help you improve your website in order to boost your rankings on search engines whenever there are relevant searches in your service area.
Instead of picking up a phonebook or keeping business cards, most people now turn to search engines to find products and services.
However, Google and other search platforms employ complex algorithms in order to create a list of results whenever a search is performed.
By focusing on SEO, you’ll adjust the right variables and increase your chances of landing on the top 10 results. Which can heavily boost the amount of traffic you get on your site.
is the practice of making adjustments to your website and other areas in order to boost your organic rankings on search engines.
Focusing on your website’s SEO has become a major digital marketing strategy because it allows you to connect with users while they conduct queries on search engines. Many of these individuals use search engines to find products and services, so having a digital marketing strategy crafted to claim the top spots on Google is a great way to engage and convert these users.
Unlike PPC campaigns, you don’t have to pay for the website traffic you generate through SEO. And, search engine optimization can also boost other tactics you implement, including social media marketing, content marketing, email marketing, and inbound marketing, among others.
If there is one thing you should take away from our digital marketing basics is the power of your website.
Your target audience sees your website as a direct reflection of your company. If your pages are slow, have an unappealing design, and fail to provide relevant information. On the contrary, having a more modern site that contains fast, functional pages packed with useful information can boost your lead generation.
But, how do you make sure your site has all the necessary elements?
Conversion rate optimization, also known as CRO, is the practice of adjusting your content in order to generate a higher number of leads. In CRO, the term “conversion” refers to a sale, quote request, consulting booking, or any other type of interaction you proactively want to achieve.
So, implementing a CRO digital marketing strategy means that you’re constantly reviewing your content and making adjustments to help improve performance. But, for this to ha[[en, you need to familiarize yourself with the different digital channels in your strategy and how they impact your website performance.
Adjusting on-site engagement variables and focusing on user experience as a whole has become one of the best methods to generate leads online.
Whether your traffic comes from a search engine, content marketing, or email marketing campaign, your visitors won’t become leads if they have a bad experience.
You can improve this by focusing on the variables that, albeit small, have a huge impact on the way users interact and perceive your site. These elements include site speed, contrast, page design, images used, and many other variables.
Moreover, you should also implement conversion and engagement-driving features, including email marketing subscription pop-ups, exit intent pop-ups, and similar elements.
One of the reasons why traditional marketing tactics are becoming obsolete is that they target a large group of consumers that haven’t shown any previous interest in the products being promoted.
Inbound marketing takes a completely different approach as this digital technique focuses on targeting would-be customers who have displayed an interest in your products.
But, instead of relying on one single platform, inbound marketing encompasses all digital tactics that can be used to target engaged consumers.
An inbound marketing strategy can include both paid and organic techniques such as pay-per-click (PPC), social media marketing, SEO, and email marketing, among others.
Just remember that these should work in unison to move prospects down your marketing funnel, so you need to produce content that converts.
Content marketing is an online approach where companies focus on developing quality materials in order to attract potential customers.
The idea is to develop top-notch content that displays your knowledge while also helping target customers understand and solve their issues.
In instances where your customers would prefer to hire a specialist, content marketing increases the chances of you being their first point of contact.
In this context, website content can take on a variety of meanings.
Besides all visible parts of your website, your digital content also includes websites, PDFs, ebooks, infographics, white papers, and many other materials that aren’t always on your website.
As with other strategies, all of these should work together and entice customers to contact your business.
The idea behind content marketing is simple: create great materials that your target audience finds valuable. Whenever these prospects need assistance, they will either turn to your content marketing materials. If they can’t solve the issue, the next natural step is to contact your business and get help from a knowledgeable professional.
Although it’s easy to explain, creating a content marketing strategy that actually works is much more difficult.
First off, you need to create a blueprint based on your goals and resources and have the right marketing automation flows in place. Plus, you have to publish a blog post weekly at the least, make sure it’s relevant content, and monitor online reviews for this form of inbound marketing to be successful.
Pay-per-click advertising refers to a collection of digital promotion methods that allow you to purchase online ads.
PPC is not an organic technique because it relies on paid ads, so you’ll need to pay for every customer that clicks on your ads, enters your site, or completes a action.
There are countless platforms that allow you to develop PPC campaigns, but Google Ads (previously Google AdWords) is by far the biggest and most reliable alternative.
This platform allows you to reach a huge percentage of users in your service area while also offering the ability to limit which users see your ads based on demographic data.
is a form of online paid advertising. As you can probably deduce, this type of digital marketing focuses on promoting your goods through paid platforms.
Google Ads (previously known as Google Adwords) has become the best place to run paid digital marketing campaigns. The practice of promoting your company through Google and other search engines is called search engine marketing or .
Not to be confused with search marketing (which includes both paid and organic), SEM PPC ads are performance-based. In PPC advertising, companies only have to pay for interactions like clicks and, in some cases, even conversions. This means that you don’t have to pay for users simply viewing your ads, although this option is also available.
That said, social media platforms can also offer great alternatives depending on your goals and industry.
Today, companies use their social media accounts for lead generation because these networks have become dependable sources of quality, qualified leads.
Although Facebook is still the most popular social network, businesses can choose from a collection of platforms that include LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok. Each of which have their specific tactical use-cases.
Business owners can establish a social media presence through both organic posting and boosting which aids in brand awareness. While Social paid advertising provides a means of targeting specific audiences with creative ads within the context of their use of these platforms.
Therefore, you need to understand your target audience in order to decide whether you should opt for paid social media advertising or organic techniques.
Social media marketing may not be as old as email marketing, but there is no doubt that the former can generate formidable results. This is because consumers now use social media channels like Facebook and Instagram to research companies before purchasing from them.
In addition to designing engaging organic marketing social media posts, remember that you can also opt for paid ads. Social media advertising allows you to place different types of ads throughout networks in a variety of formats.
But, you need to understand the different social media ads options at your disposal in order to build a great campaign.
Some business owners see email marketing as an outdated form of digital marketing. But, that couldn’t be further from the truth.
Despite the fact that it’s among the oldest forms of digital promotion, email marketing can help you build a strong connection with your audience.
This technique can amplify the success of the content you produce while driving traffic to your site and generating quality leads.
But, remember that consumers are bombarded with hundreds of emails every single day.
Because of this, email campaigns are arguably the hardest to create and deploy, which is the reason why many businesses find it hard to achieve success.
If digital marketing strategies were cars, email marketing would be one of those classics that can compete with today’s modern wonders.
Email marketing is a superb technique because it can boost your branding, funnel building, and lead generation efforts simultaneously. That said, building a solid email marketing campaign takes a significant amount of time and effort.
Your email marketing sequences need to be divided into different parts to reflect your funnel. Moreover, in addition to promotional materials, your sequences should also include additional content, like posts on your blog, for your digital marketing work to be successful.
Video marketing is an umbrella term that includes all channels that help you share rich media content.
The reason why this technique makes our cut is that video content is more engaging, not to mention the fact that it’s extremely versatile. Videos can be used on your website, but also on social media posts, emails (via link), ads, and other channels.
For your video ads to have the right impact, you need to make sure that it portrays you like a knowledgeable expert.
Besides the accuracy and usefulness of the content, also remember that your audience will judge the production quality and assume they reflect your company as a whole.
Business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) companies target completely different audiences, which means that their marketing techniques are very different.
So, even though digital marketing is suitable for both types of industry, you should choose the best channels based on which category your business is in.
B2C digital marketing techniques tend to be more affordable than B2B due to the fact that the former usually promote lower-ticket items.
This means that these businesses can have a longer marketing funnel that requires nurturing at several stages.
B2B businesses, on the other hand, often sell products that are more expensive than the average consumer good.
This results in a lower sales volume, which means that B2B companies can’t always have a long funnel and may require techniques that result in more direct sales.
The type of business you run will directly impact your marketing strategy. But, remember that you always need to create a tailored plan designed specifically for your organization.
Now that we have a better understanding of the components of digital marketing, let’s take a look at **the 10 general steps that most businesses need to take to do digital marketing**
Before you start making marketing decisions, you need to know who your audience is and what drives them.
Therefore, the first step you need to take is to create buyer personas, or detailed descriptions of your ideal customer.
The secret to creating buyer personas is to conduct research and gain insights into your potential customers.
In most cases, the best approach is to study your best customer base and attempt to retrace the steps they took to becoming paying clients.
Once you do this, you’ll be able to understand what barriers they had to overcome before making a purchase, which will enable you to reverse-engineer a better approach.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to limit yourself to one buyer persona.
As a matter of fact, you should create a few personas to represent your ideal customers and create marketing campaigns to attract these individuals.
Even though the main objective is to make money, all companies have different digital marketing goals.
Instead of simply thinking about them, you should write these down and share them with your team so that everyone knows what they are working to achieve.
For example, if you choose to implement a content marketing strategy, tell your team members what materials you will create and how these will help you achieve more sales.Remember to be realistic with your expectations in order to set yourself up for success.
If you set the bar too high or too low, you won’t be able to properly gauge your progress. Your best bet is to look at your business performance over the last 6 or 12-month period and work on improving your numbers gradually.
As we covered already, there are many different platforms where you can promote your goods and services online.
From social media ads to search engines that drive organic traffic and everything in between, you can promote your business in a variety of ways.
But, this doesn’t mean that your marketing strategy should include all of these.
You should focus on spending your marketing budget on the platforms where your audience spends the most time.
For example, if you sell retail products for young adults, there’s a strong chance that creating a paid social advertising plan and running social media ads should be part of your strategy.
Now that you have an idea of which digital channels you will opt for, you can start acquiring the tools you’ll need to run your campaigns.
The tools you need to develop campaigns for paid search advertising, social media, and organic traffic acquisition are different.
So, you either need to identify the best set of tools or find a powerful solution that includes all the features you need.
Having a marketing team or experienced digital marketer can eliminate countless hours of researching and testing.
So, if you’re already under a lot of pressure, you can rely on digital marketing lead generation specialists like Fannit to take care of your social media channels and other platforms.
Once you have all the tools you’ll need, you can start creating a step-by-step plan.
You need to be as detailed as possible when developing your marketing strategy and make sure that your digital marketing campaigns are aligned.
This means that your branding, message, tone, and other elements should be the same across all platforms.
When you create your actual strategy, you’ll be able to accurately predict how much digital marketing work needs to be done.
Use this data to create a time-sensitive content creation, posting, and distribution schedule to hold yourself accountable and stay on track.
FYI—We have a full article on .
While it’s true that running a digital marketing campaign requires a significant amount of work, you can use marketing automation software to expedite repetitive tasks.
Instead of sending out a manual welcome message, you should make sure that your email marketing platform allows you to automate this message while also customizing recipient data, like name, automatically.
The main goal of marketing automation is to support your lead generation, so avoid automating actions that require a human touch, like developing blog content.
Search engine bots can detect when web content was developed solely for the purpose of good search engine optimization (SEO), which can actually produce a negative impact on rankings.
If you’re having difficulties developing content for social media platforms or search engine marketing ads, you can always partner with digital marketers that specialize in generating leads through these channels.
After creating your digital marketing plan, it’s time to deploy your content. The deployment process will look very different from one business to the next.
Some companies will simply start producing better content that results in higher search engine rankings, while others may unveil entirely new websites.
Whichever the case may be, remember to always target channels that your audience members use the most and stay on top of any trends that may affect your digital marketing campaign.
The world of online desktop and mobile marketing is always changing, so keep an eye out for new social media platforms, , and similar updates.
A lot of businesses invest resources into building digital advertising content, but not many focus on keeping open communication lines.
Whether it’s to ask about a product, request a quote, or leave feedback, your customers should be able to reach your company.
In the past, this represented a major investment for businesses.
Today, techniques like social media marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) allow businesses to provide attention seemingly around the clock without having to spend a small fortune.
Having the right branding elements is essential, but you need to go beyond and establish a unique identity to build a trusting relationship with your audience.
Rather than posting mission and vision statements, you should integrate your company identity into your digital marketing campaign and make sure that your content reflects your business culture.
While many businesses only use Google Ads for generating prospects, you can also use paid search engine marketing platforms to establish a unique company identity.
That said, creating a wholesome strategy that helps you establish an identity through more subtle techniques often yields the best results.
It doesn’t matter what type of digital marketing strategy or digital marketing campaign you opt for, you should track the performance of your content and optimize it.
The optimization process consists of making adjustments to your content based on its performance.
So, if you notice you’re attracting traffic from unrelated search terms, you may need to adjust your content and eliminate the keywords that are triggering these rankings.
Every paid search engine marketing and organic promotion channel has distinct metrics.
So, you need to familiarize yourself with the metrics you need to monitor and know what range these values need to reach in order to be successful.

“I hired FANNIT to build me a website. 6 months after launch my company did an extra $750k in revenue because of the leads the website was driving. Now, we are going to do the rest of their program.”
“FANNIT’s services resurrected our business and made us a viable, productive company again. We are now stronger than ever. It felt like a miracle that FANNIT knew how to get New Life Rockeries back into the green.”

“We couldn’t have built our business without FANNIT. They’ve shown us how digital marketing works and have generated the local leads we’ve needed to keep our crews thriving.”
“Fannit transformed our Kingston Radon in just 5 months! Our Google maps traffic soared, and we now rank for 1,400 new keywords. Their services have significantly increased our leads and revenue.”

As a video production services company we had not considered social prospecting before FANNIT approached us about it, but the program they have going for us in the Seattle market is driving at least 20 marketing qualified leads our way each month.
FANNIT’s team started doing Inbound Marketing for New Life Rockeries back in 2011. Since then, they’ve helped take the company from where we were at to more than tripling our revenue from their efforts. They do an amazing job with content and lead generation. I would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to generate leads online in the construction or landscaping industry.
Neil exercises honest, transparent business practices stemming from his high ethical integrity and entrepreneurial aptitudes and is quick to listen. I would recommend Neil, and FANNIT.com to anyone looking to assist their internet marketing efforts.
FANNIT’s services resurrected my business and made me a viable, productive company again. I am now stronger than ever in 40 years of business. It felt like a miracle that FANNIT knew how to get New Life Rockeries back into the green and in touch with people looking for my services. Thank you, FANNIT. I wish we had been involved with a marketing company sooner and received the benefits of their services. They showed me the power of online marketing in how to reach customers. I was amazed at how professional FANNIT was in helping us turn around. They were amazing.
Keith is a leader and industry expert when it comes to SEO and Internet Marketing. Keith and the FANNIT team have fresh ideas and bring an impressive work ethic to the projects and clients they work with.
Tapia Designs: Design & Development for Everything Web & Mobile 
Professional, results-driven comprehensive approach tailored to meet the needs of our industry.
Professional and Personable. Customized to specifically meet our requirements. It would be easy to simply lump our type of business in with other similar operating businesses, and cookie-cutter our website. FANNIT has created a solution that allows our uniqueness to come through, and our customers constantly remind us how easy and informative our website is. Bottom line it translates to increased traffic and sales!
Hiring FANNIT to be our Internet Marketing team after our new website was built was one of the best decisions I’ve made – they have given us a competitive advantage in the engineering, design, and metal fabrication industry.
From the beginning of our relationship with FANNIT they’ve proved themselves – I would definitely recommend them as a great digital marketing firm!
The FANNIT team has been great to work with from the beginning. They brought a refreshing transparency in their role as marketing support and really helped give us insight into how specific marketing channels were performing and how it was impacting our sales directly. They also provided insight into their marketing campaigns that helped me make decisions on next steps and where campaign budget would be best spent. I’d recommend them to anyone in the automotive industry.
FANNIT has provided the Community Health Center of Snohomish County with Internet marketing leadership, great content, and has helped us increase traffic and new patient conversions – they are easy to work with and provide great value with our marketing budget.
After working with FANNIT for the past couple of years, I would absolutely say that they are a great marketing & SEO company – I highly recommend them!
Plastic surgery is a competitive field to do internet marketing in. Our surgical group has tried working with other SEO companies and found FANNIT to be much easier to work with and transparent about their work. FANNIT is always quick to clarify expectations and results. They provide our surgical group with an easy to understand monthly report that tells me exactly where my lead volume is at in comparison to previous months. Having this really helps our group stay on top of the leads and sales of our company.
The FANNIT Inbound Marketing team has helped me connect with my target market in a personal way through web design and content which increased the right type of leads coming into our Managed Service Provider’s Pipeline by 125%.
I love how personable and reachable Keith, Neil, and the rest of the staff are. If I have a concern, I can email (and even text!) them and receive a prompt reply. I have been working with FANNIT since December of 2016 and to date, I have nothing negative to report They are reliable, consistent, honest, and I am glad I have them on my team. I was ready to take my small medical practice to the next level. I knew that I needed to expand my online marketing presence and SEO but I didn’t really know where to start and who to trust. Most marketing companies are crazy expensive and only work hard for you for the first few months and then drop off the radar. FANNIT has been consistent with meeting our weekly and monthly deadlines and goals. I love that they reach out to ME with feedback and progress reports instead of having to bug them for updates. My business has exploded this past 9 months and I owe it all to FANNIT. I give them 5 out of 5 stars!
