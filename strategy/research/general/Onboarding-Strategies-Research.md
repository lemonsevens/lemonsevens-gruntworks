# Onboarding Strategies for SaaS in Traditional Industries: Lessons for Gruntworks

## Introduction
Onboarding is a **make-or-break phase** for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies serving traditional, non-technical industries. Customers like construction managers, lawyers, truck fleet operators, or farmers are often extremely **time-scarce and tech-hesitant**, yet they manage complex, long-term projects. Successful SaaS firms in these spaces have learned to **minimize friction**, **educate users gently**, show **tangible value early**, **build user confidence**, and **sustain engagement** over multi-year lifecycles. Many offer *productized services with high-touch elements* – blending software with dedicated support – to ensure even non-technical clients succeed. 

This report examines how leading SaaS companies (in construction tech, legal tech, logistics, agtech, etc.) **onboard and retain traditional-industry customers**, and distills actionable tactics. We then translate these tactics into clear recommendations for **Gruntworks**, considering its audience of busy landscaping business owners who may feel overwhelmed by new technology. Real-world examples are included to illustrate each strategy and why it works.

## Minimizing Onboarding Friction for Time-Scarce Users
For users who are busy running job sites or crews, the first rule of onboarding is **“make it as easy as possible.”** Successful SaaS providers drastically reduce the effort required from the customer during setup:

- **Hands-On Setup & Data Migration:** High-touch onboarding often includes migrating the client’s existing data (contacts, jobs, records) into the new system and configuring it on their behalf. For example, **Clio**, a legal practice platform, advertises “worry-free data migration,” where their team helps import all of a firm’s contacts and files into Clio ([Clio Legal Software Plans & Pricing | Bundle & Save Over 15%](https://www.clio.com/pricing/#:~:text=Worry)). Similarly, **ServiceTitan** (field service SaaS) will **import customer records, job history, price lists, etc.** as part of implementation ([Complete Guide to ServiceTitan Onboarding and Implementation](https://titanprotechnologies.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-servicetitan-onboarding-and-implementation/#:~:text=)). This **eliminates a huge burden** on the client and lets them start using the software with their own data right away. **Jobber**, serving home service businesses, even offers “unlimited onboarding” on its top plan – including a dedicated specialist and **coordination of data import** so the customer can “seamlessly transition” their workflow into the app ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=Key%20account%20onboarding%20%E2%80%93%20Maximize,set%20you%20up%20for%20success)). By doing the heavy lifting, these companies **free up busy owners** to focus on their business rather than on tedious setup tasks.

- **Pre-Configured Templates & Defaults:** Many successful products come with **industry-specific templates, settings, and dashboards pre-loaded**. This way, new users aren’t facing a blank slate. **Smokeball** (legal case management software) provides *ready-made workflow templates* tailored to different areas of law, giving law firms “terrific starting points” that are easily customized ([Smokeball Workflows Support Your Law Firm Training and Mentorship - Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/blog/use-smokeball-workflows-to-support-your-law-firm-training-and-mentorship#:~:text=And%20a%20good%20provider%20of,your%20team%20up%20for%20success)). Their training team will even walk the client through adjusting these workflows to fit the firm’s needs ([Smokeball Workflows Support Your Law Firm Training and Mentorship - Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/blog/use-smokeball-workflows-to-support-your-law-firm-training-and-mentorship#:~:text=And%20a%20good%20provider%20of,your%20team%20up%20for%20success)). This approach jumpstarts the user’s configuration with best practices. In a similar vein, a farming software might preload a few example field templates, or a construction app might include sample project structures. **Pre-filled defaults** shorten the time to get value – users don’t have to configure everything from scratch.

- **Streamlined Setup Checklists:** Effective onboarding often uses **checklists or step-by-step roadmaps** so the process is clear and not overwhelming. For instance, **Followup CRM** (a sales tool for contractors) follows a concise 3-step onboarding: (1) a kickoff call to align on goals and timeline, (2) a setup call to configure users and data, and (3) a go-live call to train the rest of the team ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%201)) ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%203)). This structured checklist (with each step explicitly defined) keeps busy clients on track without overloading them. It also signals progress – each completed step is a quick win. Internally, many SaaS also incorporate **in-app onboarding wizards** or progress bars (for example, showing “3 of 5 setup steps complete”) to gently nudge users to finish key tasks. By breaking setup into bite-sized tasks with visual progress indicators, **time-pressed users can tackle onboarding in short bursts** and feel accomplishment at each step.

In summary, minimizing friction means **removing obstacles and unnecessary effort**. The more a SaaS vendor can **do for the customer (data imports, configuration)** and the more they can **guide via templates and checklists**, the faster a non-technical user can get up and running. This is crucial for Gruntworks, whose landscaping clients won’t tolerate a drawn-out or confusing setup. Gruntworks should aim to handle as much of the setup as possible on behalf of the client and provide a clear, stepwise path for any actions the client must take.

## Educating and Guiding Non-Technical Users Effectively
Users in traditional sectors often **need extra guidance** to feel comfortable with new software. They may not have an IT background, so successful companies combine **personal training with user-friendly self-serve tools** to educate them at the right pace:

- **Dedicated Onboarding Specialists & Training Calls:** High-touch SaaS vendors frequently assign a **personal onboarding specialist or team** to each new customer. For example, **Smokeball** pairs each new law firm with an onboarding specialist immediately after signup ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Once%20your%20Smokeball%20sales%20rep,about%20your%20firm%E2%80%99s%20unique%20goals)). This specialist conducts an introduction call to map out the onboarding plan and then schedules training sessions. Smokeball’s goal is to have the firm handling real client work in the software within 30 days, and then they spend the next 60–90 days ensuring the firm is “100% comfortable” using all aspects of the system ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=call%2C%20your%20specialist%20will%20detail,about%20your%20firm%E2%80%99s%20unique%20goals)) ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Smokeball%20platform%21%20After%20that%2C%20we%E2%80%99ll,comfortable%20with%20our%20software)). During this period, the specialist provides one-on-one guidance, answers questions, and adapts the training to the firm’s workflows. The **human touch** is critical for non-technical users – it builds trust that *“someone is there to help us if we get stuck.”* Other companies use a similar approach: **Clio** assigns mid-sized law firm clients a dedicated Customer Success Manager plus an onboarding specialist, so there is always a go-to person for questions ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=%2A%20,Success%20Manager)). By **hand-holding early on**, these specialists can patiently teach the software’s functionality, contextualize it in the user’s business process, and ensure the client doesn’t get lost or frustrated. 

- **Multi-Session Training Programs:** Rather than a single overwhelming tutorial, successful onboarding often involves a **series of training sessions** that build up the user’s skills. Smokeball’s onboarding includes a **“Foundations” training series** (multiple sessions spread out) – first covering basic navigation and how to open a first matter, then later covering advanced capabilities like task management, calendaring, billing, automation, etc., once the user is comfortable with basics ([Welcome to Smokeball: Your onboarding plan – Smokeball Support Hub](https://support.smokeball.com/hc/en-us/articles/9518197246231-Welcome-to-Smokeball-Your-onboarding-plan#:~:text=Foundations%20Training%201%20%E2%80%93%20Basics)) ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Your%20Smokeball%20training%20starts%20during,up%20the%20way%20you%20like)). This phased education prevents information overload. Users can practice the basics and see initial results before adding more complex features. Many vendors tailor training content to the customer’s context – e.g. Smokeball’s training is “built to work for your specific firm and practice area,” and their team configures the software to match the firm’s terminology and preferences as part of training ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=get%20your%20firm%20up%20and,up%20the%20way%20you%20like)). This personalization makes the education immediately relevant. **Gruntworks should consider a similar staged training**: perhaps an initial session to get a landscaper using core features (e.g. scheduling a job and sending an invoice), then follow-up sessions a couple weeks later for advanced modules (like detailed cost analytics or marketing tools). This drip-fed learning aligns with how non-tech users best absorb new tools.

- **Interactive Walkthroughs and Self-Guided Tutorials:** In addition to live training, many SaaS products incorporate **in-app guidance** so users can learn by doing. Tooltips, interactive product tours, and “Coach marks” can highlight key buttons or steps inside the software. For example, a user logging in the first time might be greeted with a guided tour that shows, *“Click here to add your first client,”* then *“This is your schedule dashboard,”* etc. Some companies use third-party user onboarding tools (like Appcues or UserGuiding) to implement these. The benefit is that busy users can explore on their own time, and **the software itself teaches them** with contextual tips. If a user skips a feature, the system can later nudge them (“Need help setting up your price list? Click here for a quick setup wizard.”). Combined with this, successful firms provide a **robust knowledge base and video tutorials** for self-serve learning. For instance, **Jobber** offers a Help Center with “First Steps: Basic Account Setup” guides and short how-to videos on common tasks ([Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us#:~:text=How%20can%20we%20help%3F%20%C2%B7,Clients%20See%20in%20Client%20Hub)). **Smokeball’s Support Hub** includes articles like “Important first steps for new firms” and even an **online community forum** where users ask questions and share tips ([Welcome to Smokeball: Your onboarding plan – Smokeball Support Hub](https://support.smokeball.com/hc/en-us/articles/9518197246231-Welcome-to-Smokeball-Your-onboarding-plan#:~:text=Grow%2FProsper%2B%20Bill)) ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=most%20times%20within%20the%20hour)). These resources empower users to get answers 24/7 (critical when they are too busy during work hours and might log in afterhours to figure something out). Gruntworks should ensure it has a **library of simple tutorials (ideally with screenshots or videos)** tailored to landscapers – e.g. “How to schedule your first mowing route” – so clients can learn features at their own pace.

- **Plain Language and Contextual Relevance:** Effective education for non-technical folks means **avoiding jargon** and teaching in their language. The onboarding specialists at these companies are not just software experts; they often have industry expertise and speak the client’s terminology. Clio’s support team, for example, is composed of “in-house legal industry experts” who understand law firm workflows ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=A%20partner%20in%20your%20success)). This means when training a law firm, they can frame features in terms of legal use cases (matters, filings, etc.). Similarly, Gruntworks should train its onboarding team to use **landscaping vocabulary** and examples – talk about crews, maintenance schedules, estimates for yard projects – so that every training moment feels directly applicable to the user’s daily work. This relevance dramatically increases user confidence in learning the system.

By combining **personal guidance** (onboarding managers, scheduled trainings) with **user-friendly self-serve tools**, successful SaaS companies create a supportive learning environment. Non-technical users feel like “the software company is by our side, teaching us how to succeed.” For Gruntworks, mimicking this approach – e.g., assigning each new landscaping business a friendly onboarding coach and providing rich on-demand learning materials – will help even tech-shy clients gradually gain mastery of the platform.

## Demonstrating Clear Value Early
In traditional industries, skepticism toward new technology is common. The fastest way to overcome hesitation is to **prove the software’s value early in the relationship**. Successful SaaS firms deliberately engineer the onboarding so that customers see tangible benefits or results within the first few weeks:

- **Quick Wins in Workflow:** Many onboarding programs focus on getting the customer to **complete a key task or workflow very soon after launch**. The idea is to identify the feature that addresses the client’s biggest pain point and ensure they use it right away, so they experience an “aha” moment. For example, a construction project management tool might aim to have the client run their next project meeting through the software within the first week, so they immediately notice communication is easier. **Smokeball’s approach** explicitly targets having a new firm manage their *first client matter* in the system within 30 days ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=call%2C%20your%20specialist%20will%20detail,about%20your%20firm%E2%80%99s%20unique%20goals)) – once the firm sees a case progressing smoothly with Smokeball (e.g. documents generated, tasks tracked), the value is concrete. Similarly, **Clio’s onboarding team** emphasizes that if you fully implement Clio, *“they will be there with you”* and **“you will immediately net what you used to gross”**, meaning the efficiency gains show up as financial impact right away ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=King%2C%20Managing%20Partner%20at%20King,Law%20Offices)). While this quote is aspirational, it highlights Clio’s confidence that clients should notice real improvements (like time saved or bills increased) almost **immediately after onboarding ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=King%2C%20Managing%20Partner%20at%20King,Law%20Offices))**. Gruntworks should identify what a “quick win” looks like for a landscaper – perhaps getting their first online booking through the system, or generating a professional proposal that gets accepted by a client, all within the first couple of weeks. Achieving a meaningful task early builds excitement and proves the software’s worth.

- **Goal Setting and Progress Tracking:** Successful SaaS implementations often start by defining **success metrics or goals** with the client. ServiceTitan’s onboarding, for instance, involves assessing the business’s needs and setting clear objectives (e.g. “increase scheduling efficiency” or “reduce time to invoice”) ([Complete Guide to ServiceTitan Onboarding and Implementation](https://titanprotechnologies.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-servicetitan-onboarding-and-implementation/#:~:text=,Metrics)) ([Complete Guide to ServiceTitan Onboarding and Implementation](https://titanprotechnologies.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-servicetitan-onboarding-and-implementation/#:~:text=ServiceTitan%20offers%20a%20wide%20range,pricing%20structures%2C%20and%20service%20agreements)). By doing this, the vendor and client know what “value” looks like. Then, as soon as the system goes live, they can measure progress toward those goals. Some companies will provide **reports or check-ins at 30 or 60 days** highlighting the early results. For example, after a month a vendor might show, “You’ve scheduled 50 jobs through our system and saved 10 hours versus your old manual method.” These data points reinforce that the promised value is real. **Followup CRM** actually sets up *trackable goals during onboarding* (on the “Setup call,” they configure the KPIs the customer wants to track) ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%202)). By the time of the go-live and first use, those metrics can start ticking. Gruntworks could adopt this by working with new customers to set a few key targets (e.g. “reduce no-show appointments by 20%” or “book 5 extra jobs in the first month via automated follow-ups”) and then monitoring those. Sharing a **“progress report” after the initial period** showing improvements will clearly illustrate value.

- **Pilot Projects or Phased Rollout for Proof of Concept:** In complex B2B deployments (especially for larger organizations), some companies will do a **phased onboarding** – for instance, start with one department, one region, or one project as a pilot. This contained approach allows the customer to see success on a small scale, which then justifies expanding to the whole business. **Procore**, targeting large construction firms, recommends forming an internal rollout team and phasing the implementation across projects ([Procore Implementation Roadmap - Procore](https://support.procore.com/customer-success/implementation-roadmap#:~:text=Procore%27s%20Customer%20Success%20team%20is,your%20company%27s%20priorities%20in%20implementation)) ([Procore Implementation Roadmap - Procore](https://support.procore.com/customer-success/implementation-roadmap#:~:text=Choosing%20your%C2%A0Procore%20Committee)). They ensure each pilot project team is fully trained and then use that success story to roll out company-wide. While Gruntworks’s clients are likely smaller (a single landscaping business may not need a multi-phase rollout internally), the principle of **not trying to “boil the ocean” on Day 1** still applies. It might mean encouraging new users to start with one module of Gruntworks at first – for example, use just the scheduling module for a couple of weeks to get comfortable, then layer on the billing module. This way the user gets value from scheduling (crews show up on time, fewer scheduling errors) without being overwhelmed by every feature at once. As their comfort grows and the value is proven in one area, they’ll be eager to adopt more.

- **Immediate ROI Communication:** The best onboarding experiences actively **call out the early wins** to the customer. They don’t assume the user will notice every benefit; instead, they communicate it. For example, a SaaS might send an email after the first month saying, “Congrats! In your first 30 days on our platform, you completed 120 work orders and received $50,000 in paid invoices – here’s how that compares to before.” This reinforces the decision to adopt the software. **TRUX**, the construction logistics platform, advises scheduling business reviews even as early as a few weeks in, to highlight usage and value: a focused effort in the first month makes it more likely the entire team will leverage the software long-term ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=SWAT%20Team%20Support%3A%20This%20means,select%20can%20handle%20these%20key)). They suggest using real data in these reviews to *“crystallize the value you are getting”* by diving into analytics and examples ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Weekly%2FMonthly%20Business%20Reviews%3A%20Carving%20time,getting%20from%20utilizing%20logistics%20software)). In essence, they turn early usage data into a proof of concept for the investment. Gruntworks can similarly provide a simple **“value recap” to new customers after 1–2 months**, showing metrics like jobs completed, hours saved, or revenue generated through the platform, thereby making the payoff of onboarding explicit.

The overarching goal is to **combat the natural skepticism and anxiety of non-technical users by showing results** right away. Early success creates positive momentum: it builds user buy-in (“I see this working for me”) and encourages broader use of the system. For Gruntworks, ensuring landscaping owners see a payoff – whether time saved on scheduling or quicker payments – in the first few weeks will greatly reduce churn and boost word-of-mouth. 

## Building Confidence and Reducing Perceived Risk
Adopting new software can feel risky for a traditional business – will it disrupt operations, is it worth the cost, what if it fails? Top SaaS companies actively work to **reduce these fears and build the customer’s confidence** in the partnership. Here’s how they do it:

- **Personalized, “White-Glove” Service:** Many providers position themselves not just as software vendors but as **ongoing partners in the customer’s success**. This relational approach builds confidence because the customer feels “we’re in this together.” **Trux**, for example, emphasizes a *white-glove onboarding service* for its construction clients, noting the benefits of having a **dedicated account manager** who knows your business and is always available for questions ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Dedicated%20Account%20Manager%3A%20%C2%A0Having%20access,catered%20to%20your%20specific%20needs)). They even deploy a **SWAT team in the first month** – an intensive support team that does hands-on training, “dry-run” simulations with the client’s team, and helps communicate the change internally ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=SWAT%20Team%20Support%3A%20This%20means,It%20is)). This high-touch engagement reassures the client that they won’t be left to fend for themselves; if any issue arises, help is immediate. It also shows confidence on the vendor’s part: they are willing to invest time with the customer because they know their solution works. **Smokeball** similarly provides “hands-on onboarding, training and expertise from the day you become a client,” with specialists even performing technical tasks like installing the software on all the firm’s devices and running post-install tests ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=,by%20one%20of%20our%20technicians)). By the time the customer is fully onboarded, they’ve had dozens of touchpoints with knowledgeable staff, giving them confidence that the vendor truly understands their needs and can handle any hiccups. Gruntworks can mirror this by **assigning a dedicated onboarding coach for each new landscaping company**, essentially a “project manager” for their onboarding. Regular check-ins (say, a quick call every week during the first month) will reassure the client that progress is being made and any concerns are immediately addressed.

- **Risk-Reversal Policies (Guarantees and Flexible Terms):** To remove the sense of risk, some SaaS firms offer guarantees or trial periods that **lower the barrier to commit**. For instance, **Followup CRM** boldly advertises a 30-day money-back guarantee for new customers, saying it “proves how confident we are that you’ll love [the product]” ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=30)). This kind of guarantee directly tackles the fear of “What if this doesn’t work for me? I don’t want to waste money.” By promising a full refund if the client isn’t satisfied within the first month, Followup CRM transfers risk away from the customer. Another example: **ExactHire** (HR software) similarly offered a 60-day money-back guarantee on its onboarding software ([ExactHire Guarantees](https://www.exacthire.com/exacthire-guarantees/#:~:text=To%20that%20end%2C%20we%20offer,OnboardCentric%20Employee%20Onboarding%20Software)). Even if a formal money-back guarantee isn’t feasible, many enterprise SaaS deals include *opt-out clauses or pilot periods* where the customer can cancel if certain milestones aren’t met. Additionally, **month-to-month pricing options or free trial periods** serve as a form of risk reduction. **Clio**, for example, lets new users start with a free 7-day trial (no credit card) and explicitly states “Cancel anytime” with no long-term contract ([Clio Legal Software Plans & Pricing | Bundle & Save Over 15%](https://www.clio.com/pricing/#:~:text=Flexible%20plans%20with%20live%20support%2C,free%20data%20migration)) ([Clio Legal Software Plans & Pricing | Bundle & Save Over 15%](https://www.clio.com/pricing/#:~:text=Get%20started%20in%20minutes,Cancel%20anytime)). For a wary customer, knowing they are not locked in if it doesn’t meet expectations can provide the confidence to move forward. Gruntworks could consider offering a **trial period or a satisfaction guarantee** to new clients – for example, “Try Gruntworks for 60 days, and if it hasn’t saved you time or met your expectations, you can walk away without paying.” Coupled with the high-touch support, this assures prospects that *they won’t get burned* by trying the new system.

- **Proof of Expertise and Industry Knowledge:** Building trust often comes down to showing “we understand your business.” Successful onboarding teams bring in domain experts or at least accumulated best practices from similar customers. Trux noted that a white-glove provider should have **extensive industry knowledge**, allowing them to anticipate the customer’s needs and not require the customer to explain every nuance ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Extensive%20Market%2FIndustry%20Knowledge%3A%20Companies%20that,a%20proven%20method%20of%20deployment)). For example, if a logistics software team knows construction hauling, they already get the concept of “hauler onboarding” and job site workflows, which saves the client from feeling like the software is naive about their world. Clio’s approach of using *legal industry veterans* on their support team is another way to instill confidence ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=A%20partner%20in%20your%20success)). When the person training you has seen hundreds of firms like yours, you trust their guidance. Gruntworks should leverage its understanding of landscaping operations in every onboarding interaction – possibly employing staff with landscaping backgrounds or compiling case studies of landscaping businesses that succeeded. By speaking the landscaper’s lingo and sharing stories (“We’ve helped companies like yours map out crew routes and saved them 5 hours a week”), the onboarding team shows credibility. This reduces perceived risk because the client feels *“okay, these folks know what they’re doing in my industry.”*

- **Small Commitments and Gradual Engagement:** Another psychological tactic to reduce fear is to start with a small commitment and build up. For example, some SaaS sales will start with a pilot project (as mentioned earlier) or a shorter initial contract (e.g. a 3-month starter plan) before moving to an annual agreement. This graduated approach can be part of onboarding – once the client sees it working, they become confident to commit more. **Guarantees of timely support** also reduce anxiety: vendors often promise things like dedicated support channels (Jobber’s top tier offers a premium support line to skip wait queues ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=The%20Plus%20plan%20is%20the,team%20leverage%20everything%20Plus%20offers)) ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=Premium%20support%20%E2%80%93%20When%20you,number%20to%20bypass%20the%20line))) or fast response SLAs. Knowing “if something breaks, I can reach support immediately” addresses the fear of downtime or unsolvable problems. In non-technical industries, customers worry a lot about “what if it fails on a busy Monday morning?” If Gruntworks can guarantee rapid support (e.g. a hotline or live chat with quick response), and even have an **onboarding week “all-hands”** where support is on standby during the customer’s first major use of the system, it will build the client’s trust that they won’t be left in a lurch.

- **Transparent Outcomes and References:** Finally, successful companies reduce perceived risk by showcasing results and **letting customers speak for them**. Onboarding time and effort is itself a concern (nobody wants a 6-month implementation nightmare). Followup CRM addresses this in their feature page: they note the “typical onboarding process is two weeks or less to go live” ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%201)), which sets a reassuring expectation. They also include a testimonial of a real customer (“Best Roofing went from $6M to $60M” using the software) right on the onboarding page ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBest%20Roofing%20went%20from%206M,to%2060M%E2%80%9D)), reinforcing that others have succeeded. This social proof can alleviate the fear of the unknown. Gruntworks should gather early success stories from any pilot clients or early adopters and use them to assure new customers: e.g. *“Landscaper X was up and running in 10 days and saw a 15% increase in crew productivity in the first quarter.”* Hearing that peers have achieved results with modest ramp-up can tip a hesitant prospect into feeling safe about proceeding.

In essence, to build confidence, **make the customer feel protected and supported at every step.** Whether through formal guarantees, constant personal support, or clear evidence that the software works for people like them, these tactics neutralize the perceived risks of change. For Gruntworks, an industry where word-of-mouth and trust matter, going the extra mile to reassure new users (and actually delivering on those reassurances) will turn nervous newcomers into enthusiastic long-term clients.

## Sustaining Engagement Throughout a Long-Term Lifecycle
Onboarding doesn’t end after the first month – especially for offerings intended to be used for **years**, maintaining engagement and delivering value over the long haul is vital. SaaS companies with long customer lifecycles put structured efforts into **customer success and continuous adoption** well beyond the go-live. Key tactics include:

- **Regular Check-ins and Business Reviews:** Successful vendors schedule periodic meetings (monthly or quarterly) to **review progress, introduce new features, and ensure the customer is happy**. These are often called **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)** or account reviews. For example, TRUX advocates for weekly or monthly business reviews during early usage, where the account manager and client discuss how the team is leveraging the software and troubleshoot any issues ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Weekly%2FMonthly%20Business%20Reviews%3A%20Carving%20time,getting%20from%20utilizing%20logistics%20software)). They use this time to also highlight new features that the client could benefit from, essentially *re-selling the value continuously* by showing more ways the tool can help ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Weekly%2FMonthly%20Business%20Reviews%3A%20Carving%20time,getting%20from%20utilizing%20logistics%20software)). Over a longer term, companies shift to quarterly cadence for such meetings. The effect is twofold: (1) the customer feels the **partnership is ongoing** – the vendor is proactively working to help them succeed, not just sold software and disappeared; and (2) it provides a forum to align on changing goals, so the software keeps delivering value as the client’s business evolves. **Smokeball’s account management team** explicitly takes this approach: after onboarding, an account manager works alongside the firm as a consultant, showing them “the next best moves” based on their business goals and even soliciting feedback for new features ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Smokeball%20client%2C%20G2%20review)). This keeps mature customers engaged and feeling heard. Gruntworks should implement a schedule of check-in calls or meetings with clients at regular intervals (e.g. a 45-day check-in, then quarterly). In these sessions, present usage stats, ask about any pain points, and suggest ways to use Gruntworks more effectively (e.g. “I noticed you haven’t tried the route optimization feature; shall we set that up to save you more time?”). This ensures the customer continues to derive increasing value, which is crucial for retention in a 1.5+ year lifecycle.

- **Ongoing Training and Refreshers:** Staff turnover or feature updates can erode a customer’s effective use of a product over time. Leading companies offer **continuous training resources** to keep users proficient and to onboard new employees at the client organization. Smokeball, notably, includes *unlimited training for any client, even if they’ve been a customer for 10 years* ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=for%201%3A1%20training%20just%20for,your%20firm)). Their trainers are available for 1:1 sessions whenever needed, and this is included at no extra cost. This is a powerful engagement strategy: clients know they can always ask for a refresher or get new team members trained without hassle. Other SaaS firms have user conferences, webinars, or “universities” where advanced topics are taught. **Procore**, for example, has an online learning portal and certification courses (Procore Learning) to encourage users to deepen their skills over time ([Procore Learning](https://learn.procore.com/#:~:text=Procore%20Learning%20Learn%20construction%20industry,App%20Integrations)) ([Procore for Main Contractors | Construction Management Software](https://www.procore.com/en-ae/main-contractors#:~:text=Procore%20for%20Main%20Contractors%20,More)). By investing in customer education continuously, these companies ensure users keep uncovering value in the platform rather than plateauing. For Gruntworks, offering periodic **webinars on advanced tips** (like seasonal workshops: “Preparing your spring schedule in Gruntworks – best practices”) or on-demand training for new hires of the landscaping business can help sustain engagement. It reminds customers of under-used features and **refreshes enthusiasm** for the software.

- **Feature Updates and Communication:** A long-term SaaS relationship will involve many product updates. Keeping non-technical users engaged means **communicating new features or improvements in a clear, benefits-oriented way**. Many companies send out newsletters or in-app announcements highlighting new capabilities *with guidance on how to use them*. For example, if an agtech platform releases a new crop yield forecasting module, they might publish a case example or host a short training to show farmers how it works and how it can help them plan better. The key is to tie product updates to user value and provide easy paths to try the new features (perhaps even with the help of the customer success manager). The aforementioned **account reviews are also an opportunity** to introduce these features in context. When users see the software constantly evolving to solve more of their problems – and are shown how to take advantage – they are more likely to stay engaged rather than switching off after the initial use cases are met. Gruntworks should ensure its customer communications highlight improvements (e.g. “New Feature: Automated Estimate Follow-ups – you can now have Gruntworks send follow-up emails to clients who haven’t responded to an estimate; here’s how this can help you close more deals”). Making these announcements relevant keeps the software feeling fresh and valuable throughout the lifecycle.

- **User Communities and Peer Engagement:** Many SaaS companies foster a **community among their users**. This could be an online forum, user group webinars, or an annual user conference. The goal is to let customers share success stories, tips, and ask questions of each other. Smokeball’s exclusive client community is one example ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=most%20times%20within%20the%20hour)). Another example is **Clio’s customer community forums and the Clio Cloud Conference** where law firm users gather to learn from peers. Community engagement sustains usage because customers often discover new ways to use the product from others and feel a sense of belonging. For traditional industry users who might not know others using such software, seeing a peer network can also reinforce the value (“if other landscaping businesses like mine are thriving with this tool, I should fully utilize it too”). Gruntworks might encourage its clients to join a community site or Slack group for landscape business owners using the platform. It could also circulate case studies or host panel discussions with successful customers. This peer-to-peer element can drive engagement without always relying on the vendor pushing from the top.

- **Proactive Usage Monitoring and Nurture:** On the backend, customer success teams often use **behavioral analytics to monitor engagement**. If a customer’s usage drops (e.g. they stop logging in regularly or haven’t touched a new critical feature), the team might proactively reach out. Some SaaS tools automatically send **“nudge” emails** based on behavior – for instance, “We noticed you haven’t scheduled any jobs this month. Can we help?” or “Tip: Teams who use the invoicing module get paid 2x faster – try it out!” These nudges can re-engage users before they fully lapse. In the first year especially, triggered email cadences are common: a user who hasn’t completed onboarding tasks might get reminder emails, or if they haven’t utilized a feature that’s known to correlate with retention, the system prompts them. One study of SaaS free trials found companies sent on average ~9 onboarding emails over the first 14 days to keep users active ([Comparing Onboarding Email Cadence Across 5 SaaS Free Trials (14 Days) | by Steph Knapp | Get Your SaaS On Board | Medium](https://medium.com/saas-onboarding-emails/comparing-onboarding-email-cadence-across-5-saas-free-trials-14-days-e7aba76fde6#:~:text=On%20average%2C%2014,6%20emails%20sent)). In long-term paid contexts, the volume is less, but the principle of timely, relevant communication holds. Gruntworks should implement a **nurture email sequence** for new customers (e.g. Day 3: “How to customize your service list”; Day 7: “Have you sent your first invoice? Here’s how”; Day 14: “Join our Q&A office hours this week”) as well as on-going triggers (e.g. an alert to the account manager if a client hasn’t logged in for 30 days, prompting a personal call). This ensures no one slips through the cracks after onboarding.

By treating the customer relationship as an ongoing journey – with support, education, and value delivery at every stage – these companies keep users engaged well beyond 1.5 years. The software becomes an integral part of the customer’s business rather than a one-off tool they might abandon. For Gruntworks, nurturing long-term engagement means **continuously proving that you are a partner invested in the landscaper’s growth**. Through regular touchpoints, training, new features, and community, Gruntworks can help its clients not only stick with the platform, but also fully realize its benefits over time (leading to renewals, upsells, and enthusiastic referrals).

## Recommendations for Gruntworks Onboarding
Based on the above insights, here are targeted recommendations for how Gruntworks can onboard and support its landscaping business clients. These tactics focus on busy, non-technical users and aim to deliver a smooth start and enduring partnership:

- **Assign a Dedicated Onboarding Coach:** Every new Gruntworks customer should be greeted by a named onboarding specialist or account manager who guides them through setup and training. This person will be the landscaper’s go-to contact from day one – scheduling calls, answering questions, and providing a personal touch. Real-world example: Smokeball introduces an onboarding specialist immediately and conducts a kickoff call to lay out the process ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Once%20your%20Smokeball%20sales%20rep,about%20your%20firm%E2%80%99s%20unique%20goals)). Gruntworks’ coach can similarly detail an onboarding game plan (e.g. “Week 1: we’ll get your client list imported and your services configured; Week 2: we train your crew leaders on the app; by Week 4 you’ll be running jobs through Gruntworks”). Knowing they have an *“expert partner”* will put non-tech-savvy owners at ease.

- **Use a Clear Checklist & Timeline:** Structure the onboarding into a checklist of key steps and share this with the client to manage expectations. For instance, Step 1: Data import, Step 2: Setup review, Step 3: Staff training, Step 4: First job go-live. Followup CRM’s 3-step onboarding (kickoff, setup, go-live in ~2 weeks) is a good model ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%201)). Gruntworks can create a simple onboarding dashboard or PDF checklist for clients to track progress. This not only keeps the busy client organized but also gives them a sense of achievement as each item is completed, reducing overwhelm.

- **Do the Heavy Lifting (Data Import & Configuration):** Minimize the work the landscaper has to do. Gruntworks should offer to import customer contacts, past job info, or price lists from whatever system the client currently uses (even if it’s Excel). This mirrors the “worry-free data migration” promise of Clio ([Clio Legal Software Plans & Pricing | Bundle & Save Over 15%](https://www.clio.com/pricing/#:~:text=Worry)) and Jobber’s onboarding which coordinates data import ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=Key%20account%20onboarding%20%E2%80%93%20Maximize,set%20you%20up%20for%20success)). Additionally, set up the account with industry-specific defaults: e.g. preload a few standard landscaping services (mowing, mulching, etc. with example prices) and a basic dashboard template. This is akin to Smokeball providing ready-made legal workflows ([Smokeball Workflows Support Your Law Firm Training and Mentorship - Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/blog/use-smokeball-workflows-to-support-your-law-firm-training-and-mentorship#:~:text=And%20a%20good%20provider%20of,your%20team%20up%20for%20success)). For a landscaper, seeing Gruntworks already configured with familiar service items and schedule templates when they first log in will dramatically lower friction – they can start using it immediately, instead of spending hours on setup.

- **Tailor Training in Bite-Sized Sessions:** Rather than one long training, break it into shorter sessions that fit into a landscaper’s hectic schedule. For example, conduct a 60-minute initial training focusing on scheduling and invoice basics (the essentials to get paid), then a follow-up 30-minute session a week later on more advanced features (routing, cost tracking, etc.). Ensure trainings use **landscaping scenarios** (“Let’s schedule a lawn maintenance route together”) to make it concrete. Smokeball’s multi-phase training (basics first, advanced later) shows this approach works to avoid overload ([Welcome to Smokeball: Your onboarding plan – Smokeball Support Hub](https://support.smokeball.com/hc/en-us/articles/9518197246231-Welcome-to-Smokeball-Your-onboarding-plan#:~:text=Foundations%20Training%201%20%E2%80%93%20Basics)) ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Your%20Smokeball%20training%20starts%20during,up%20the%20way%20you%20like)). Also, offer recordings of trainings or self-serve video modules for those who want refreshers or can’t attend live. This flexible, staggered education will accommodate the time-pressed, hands-on nature of landscape business owners.

- **Provide 24/7 Self-Serve Support (Knowledge Base & Videos):** Develop a **Help Center** geared toward common tasks a landscaper will need. Topics might include “Getting started: how to add your first client,” “Creating and sending your first quote,” “Managing your crew’s schedule on the mobile app,” etc. Populate it with easy-to-follow articles and short videos (2-3 minutes each). Jobber’s help center and Smokeball’s support hub serve as good examples ([Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us#:~:text=How%20can%20we%20help%3F%20%C2%B7,Clients%20See%20in%20Client%20Hub)) ([Welcome to Smokeball: Your onboarding plan – Smokeball Support Hub](https://support.smokeball.com/hc/en-us/articles/9518197246231-Welcome-to-Smokeball-Your-onboarding-plan#:~:text=Are%20you%20part%20of%20a,with%20your%20Client%20Success%20Manager)). Also consider a **community forum** where clients can ask questions and get answers from the Gruntworks team or other users. This way, if a question arises after hours or if the owner prefers self-learning, the resources are readily available. Ensuring these materials are written in plain, non-technical language (no jargon, lots of screenshots) is key for effective self-serve.

- **Emphasize Early Wins:** Design the onboarding so that the client achieves a meaningful result in the first 1-2 weeks. For example, aim for them to send out their first few customer invoices through Gruntworks within Week 1, or have them schedule and complete one job using the system. Once that invoice is paid faster than their usual process, or the job runs without a hitch, *call it out*. Send a quick note: “Congrats! You scheduled and completed your first job using Gruntworks – your crew spent 15% less time on paperwork for that job!” Highlighting these victories will reinforce to the skeptical user that the software is delivering value. Clio’s team, for instance, touts immediate financial gains when fully implemented ([Clio: Premium Migrations & Onboarding for Mid-sized Law Firms | Clio](https://www.clio.com/enterprise/solutions/migration/#:~:text=King%2C%20Managing%20Partner%20at%20King,Law%20Offices)), and Followup CRM sets goals to hit within two weeks ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=Step%201)). Gruntworks should similarly focus the client on a couple of core pain points (maybe scheduling inefficiency and slow invoicing) and show rapid improvement in those areas. This could be supported by a simple first-month report (e.g. “In your first month, you scheduled 40 jobs and collected $Y in payments through Gruntworks.”).

- **Offer a No-Risk Trial or Guarantee:** To lower adoption hesitancy, Gruntworks can implement a risk-reversal mechanism. For instance, offer new customers a **60-day money-back guarantee** if they are not satisfied or haven’t seen expected improvements. Followup CRM’s 30-day guarantee for contractors is a strong precedent that such offers build trust ([Onboarding Process and Training Feature | Followup CRM](https://www.followupcrm.com/features/onboarding-process#:~:text=30)). Alternatively, start with a pilot program – e.g. “try Gruntworks free for the first 30 days, with full support, and then decide whether to continue.” Landscapers who fear “wasting money on software” will be assured that if it doesn’t work for them, they can back out without loss. Of course, the goal is to wow them in those first days so they gladly continue, but removing the contractual risk is an effective psychological incentive for a traditionally risk-averse audience.

- **Ensure Fast, Human Support Response:** Busy landscaping professionals work odd hours and can’t afford downtime. Gruntworks should have a **responsive support system** – ideally with real humans readily available by phone or chat during the business day and email support off-hours. Jobber’s premium “skip the line” support for top-tier customers ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=The%20Plus%20plan%20is%20the,team%20leverage%20everything%20Plus%20offers)) ([The Plus Plan – Jobber Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/29668508840727-The-Plus-Plan#:~:text=Premium%20support%20%E2%80%93%20When%20you,number%20to%20bypass%20the%20line))reflects how important responsiveness is. For Gruntworks, even if the team is small initially, set the expectation that **questions will be answered quickly** (within an hour or two during working hours). During the onboarding phase, perhaps schedule a brief weekly “office hours” call where the client can drop in with any issues. Rapid support not only solves problems, it also signals to the client that their business is important to Gruntworks – building trust and satisfaction.

- **Leverage Industry Knowledge & Language:** Make sure all training and support interactions demonstrate *Gruntworks knows landscaping.* The onboarding specialist should reference things like seasonal work, crew management, route efficiency – showing empathy for the client’s daily challenges. For example, “I know spring clean-up season is hectic – let’s get your templates set up now so it will save you time when that rush hits.” This mirrors how Procore forms a rollout plan with a client’s internal team, speaking the construction lingo ([Procore Implementation Roadmap - Procore](https://support.procore.com/customer-success/implementation-roadmap#:~:text=Procore%27s%20Customer%20Success%20team%20is,your%20company%27s%20priorities%20in%20implementation)) ([Procore Implementation Roadmap - Procore](https://support.procore.com/customer-success/implementation-roadmap#:~:text=Choosing%20your%C2%A0Procore%20Committee)), or how Smokeball configures software to a firm’s practice area ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=get%20your%20firm%20up%20and,up%20the%20way%20you%20like)). When landscapers feel *“they get my business,”* they’ll be more engaged and trust the guidance. It may help to hire onboarding staff with backgrounds in field services or small business operations, or at least train them deeply on landscaping workflows. Use of familiar metaphors (as per Gruntworks’ brand tone, technology as an empowering tool rather than a replacement) can also reinforce that the software is meant to amplify their craft, not complicate it.

- **Maintain Engagement with Regular Follow-ups:** Once the customer is onboarded, don’t disappear. Set automated reminders for the Customer Success team to check in at 1 month, 3 months, and quarterly thereafter. In these check-ins, review how the client is using Gruntworks and suggest any features they aren’t leveraging. For example, “Hi, it looks like you’ve been using scheduling and invoicing regularly (great!). I noticed you haven’t tried the crew timesheets feature yet – would you like a quick demo of how it works? It could help track your labor costs more easily.” This approach is modeled after TRUX’s advice to have business reviews to reinforce usage ([Logistics Software Launch: Make Onboarding Successful - TRUX](https://www.truxnow.com/blog/successful-onboarding-can-make-or-break-your-logistics-software-launch#:~:text=Weekly%2FMonthly%20Business%20Reviews%3A%20Carving%20time,getting%20from%20utilizing%20logistics%20software)) and Smokeball’s account managers who guide clients to “next best moves” ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=Smokeball%20client%2C%20G2%20review)). By proactively reaching out with helpful tips (rather than waiting for the client to ask for help), Gruntworks will keep users discovering value. It also provides an avenue to gather feedback and potentially upsell new modules when appropriate. A simple practice is to email a **monthly usage summary** to the client (e.g. “This month in Gruntworks: 120 jobs scheduled, 110 invoices sent, $85k revenue recorded”) – this keeps the software’s impact front-of-mind and encourages consistent use.

- **Foster a Customer Community:** Encourage Gruntworks clients to connect, whether through a Facebook group, forum, or periodic webinar roundtables. Busy owners often learn better from peers. Gruntworks can host, for example, a quarterly virtual meetup where a successful landscaping business shares how they use the software (e.g. a customer spotlight showing their dashboard and KPIs). This not only provides practical tips to others, but also builds a sense of camaraderie (“we landscaping professionals are modernizing together”). Smokeball’s community forum ([Account Management | Smokeball](https://www.smokeball.com/account-management#:~:text=most%20times%20within%20the%20hour)) and Clio’s extensive community events show that facilitating peer interaction increases product stickiness. For Gruntworks, even starting a small online group where tips and questions are exchanged could drive engagement and loyalty. It reinforces that by joining Gruntworks, the customer is also joining a network of forward-thinking landscape businesses – tapping into their desire for growth and professionalism.

By implementing these tactics, Gruntworks can create an onboarding experience that **feels like an empowered partnership rather than a software installation.** The focus should be on making the landscaper’s life easier from day one: *Gruntworks takes care of the setup, teaches them gradually in their language, proves its value quickly, and stands by their side over the long run.* This approach will not only reduce drop-off during onboarding but also set the foundation for strong relationships that last well beyond 1.5 years, turning initially hesitant clients into confident power users and advocates for Gruntworks.
