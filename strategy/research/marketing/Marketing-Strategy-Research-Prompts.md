1. - [X] **Deep Dive into Landscaper "Cultural Codes" (Rapaille Inspired)**: Research Clotaire Rapaille's concept of "Cultural Codes" and the "Reptilian Brain." Analyze potential codes for concepts like "Control," "Craftsmanship," "Growth," and "Technology" specifically within the context of owner-operators in traditional, skilled-trade industries like landscaping. How might early imprints or primal needs shape their reactions to marketing messages about efficiency, automation, or relinquishing marketing tasks? How can Gruntworks' messaging tap into or navigate these deep-seated codes?
2. - [X] **Narrative Structures for Overcoming Tech Hesitation in B2B**: Investigate B2B marketing narratives specifically designed to overcome technology adoption barriers in traditional industries. Analyze case studies (ideally from SaaS or tech services targeting sectors like construction, agriculture, or skilled trades) where the narrative successfully reframed technology (especially AI/automation) from a "Threat" to a "Tool" or "Amplifier."

11. - [ ] **Leveraging "Strategic Vulnerability" in B2B Trust Building**: Explore the concept of "strategic vulnerability" or transparently sharing challenges/learnings as a method for building trust in B2B relationships, especially with skeptical audiences.

Provide examples relevant to how Gruntworks can position itself against "unprofessional" landscaping competitors.
13. - [X] **Applying "Satisficing" Principles to Service Package Design**: Investigate Rory Sutherland's concept of designing for "satisficing" [6] in the context of complex B2B service offerings. How can Gruntworks structure its service packages and present options to make the "good enough" choice easy and appealing for busy landscaping owners prone to decision fatigue? Analyze examples of effective tiered service models that facilitate quick, confident decisions.
14. - [ ] **Classical Conditioning in B2B Branding (Associative Architecture)**: Analyze how B2B brands implicitly use principles of classical conditioning [15] to build desired brand associations (e.g., pairing their brand with concepts of success, innovation, or reliability). Identify the Conditioned Stimuli (brand elements) and Unconditioned Stimuli (desired concepts/emotions) used in examples from successful B2B service providers. How can Gruntworks systematically apply these principles across its touchpoints (website, content, communications) to build the associations outlined in Principle 4?
15. - [ ] **Ethical Reframing Techniques in Sales Conversations**: Research ethical reframing techniques (inspired by NLP concepts but applied transparently, as noted in [37]) used in consultative B2B sales. How can salespeople help prospects see challenges (e.g., cost, complexity) as opportunities (e.g., investment, competitive advantage) without distortion or manipulation?
