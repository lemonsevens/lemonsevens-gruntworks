**Our brand:**

- **Logo Description:**
The logo for 'Gruntworks' looks like a rugged, badge-style logo built around a dark, textured hexagonal panel. Front and center sits the word “GRUNTWORKS” in chunky, all-caps, cream-colored letters that carry a worn, distressed finish. Above the name is a simple silhouette of grass blades in muted green, and below it a rough, brown-toned soil mound—both echoing the hands-on nature of landscaping. The entire emblem floats on an olive-yellow background, reinforcing an earthy, blue-collar vibe. Overall, it feels tough, straightforward and rooted in the dirt—exactly the no-nonsense look a mid-size regional landscaper’s marketing agency needs.

## Key Positioning

- **Productized Offers:** All core services (except our “Fractional Chief Automation Officer” retainer) are structured, packaged, and ready to deploy.
- **Client-Centric Philosophy:** Our brand must reflect our clients’ story—not ours. Every narrative, visual, and product name should speak directly to their world.

## Guidelines for an Over-the-Top Thematic Brand Narrative and Strategy

1. **Choose a Bold, Singular Theme**  
   - Pick a unique, memorable theme tied to a lifestyle, emotion, or cultural reference (e.g., Liquid Death’s dark humor, Dr. Squatch’s rugged masculinity).
   - Go big—make it provocative or polarizing to grab attention and set your brand apart.

2. **Tie the Name and Logo to the Theme**  
   - **Name:** Select a catchy name that reflects the theme (e.g., Kraken Rum evokes a mythical sea beast).
   - **Logo:** Design a logo with symbols, colors, and typography that visually reinforce the narrative (e.g., CrowdStrike’s falcon for speed and security).

3. **Build a Unified Visual Identity**  
   - **Colors:** Use a palette that matches the theme’s emotions (e.g., Liquid Death’s gothic blacks).
   - **Imagery:** Feature consistent visuals like photography or illustrations (e.g., Dr. Squatch’s Pacific Northwest forests).
   - **Packaging:** Ensure product design amplifies the theme (e.g., Kraken Rum’s tentacle-embossed bottles).

4. **Name Products and Services Thematically**  
   - Create product names that extend the narrative (e.g., CrowdStrike’s “Falcon Complete,” Liquid Death’s “Sell Your Soul”).
   - Avoid generic terms—opt for creative, theme-driven names.

5. **Write Thematic Messaging**  
   - **Tone:** Match the brand’s personality (e.g., Dr. Squatch’s bold, “manly” language).
   - **Tagline:** Craft a memorable slogan tied to the theme (e.g., “Murder Your Thirst”).
   - Keep all copy cohesive, avoiding bland feature-benefit statements.

6. **Design Immersive Campaigns and Experiences**  
   - Launch campaigns that tell a story or build a world (e.g., Kraken Rum’s “League of Darkness”).
   - Extend the theme to customer touchpoints like memberships or events (e.g., Liquid Death’s humorous “Sell Your Soul” program).

7. **Stay Niche and Fearless**  
   - Focus on a specific audience—don’t dilute the brand for mass appeal (unlike Zendesk or MailChimp).
   - Embrace the risk of turning some people off to build a loyal core following.

8. **Maintain Cohesion Everywhere**  
   - Ensure every element—name, visuals, products, messaging—reinforces the theme.
   - Regularly check for alignment and fix any drift.

9. **Take Inspiration from B2B (But Push Further)**  
   - B2B brands like CrowdStrike prove themes work—use bold, humanized elements like humor or storytelling to stand out.
   - Don’t play it safe; lean into the theme fully.

10. **Evolve Without Losing Focus**  
    - Grow the brand thoughtfully, keeping new offerings tied to the core theme.
    - Avoid straying into generic territory as you expand.
