# üõ†Ô∏è PROJECT SCAFFOLDING & PLANNING WORKFLOW

This document gives the step-by-step workflow for how to plan a new project. 

### Commands:
- `#start` ‚Äì Starts a new project by **executing the interactive prompt defined in** `operations/project-planning/vision-statement-generator.md`
- `#continue` ‚Äì Continues existing project by asking the location of the project directory and then launching the requirements gathering prompt  
---

## 1. Vision & Goals Definition
- **Action**: **Execute the interactive prompt located in** `operations/project-planning/vision-statement-generator.md`
- **Purpose**: Define the project's overall vision and primary objectives.
- **Goal**: Clarify what success looks like, regardless of whether the project is software, strategic, or marketing in nature.
- **Output**: Vision Statement Document

---

## 2. Scope & Requirements Gathering
- Identify key needs, stakeholder expectations, and deliverables.
- Document essential features, challenges, and strategic considerations.
- **Output**: Requirements and Scope Document
- **Location**: operations/project-planning/requirements-gathering.md
---

## 3. Resource & Methodology Selection
- Determine which tools, frameworks, or approaches fit the project‚Äîbe it a technical stack, creative tools, or strategic frameworks.
- Establish the methodology (Agile, Waterfall, Lean, etc.) that best suits the project type.
- **Output**: Resource/Methodology Strategy Document
- **Location**: operations/project-planning/resource-methodology-selection.md
---

## 4. Blueprint & Design Planning
- Develop a comprehensive plan or blueprint outlining the project structure, timeline, roles, and dependencies.
- Create a visual or written roadmap to guide execution.
- **Output**: Project Blueprint/Design Document
- **Location**: operations/project-planning/blueprint-design-planning.md
---

## 5. Task & Milestone Breakdown
- Break the project into manageable tasks or milestones.
- Detail steps that are clear, actionable, and easy to track.
- **Output**: Task Breakdown and Milestone Report
- **Location**: operations/project-planning/task-milestone-breakdown.md
---

## 6. Execution & Implementation
- Execute the identified tasks according to the plan.
- Monitor progress actively and adjust as needed in response to real-world developments.
- **Output**: Progress and Implementation Records
- **Location**: operations/project-planning/execution-implementation.md
---

## 7. Quality Assurance & Testing
- Verify that each component meets the required standards.
- For software, this means unit tests and bug fixes; for strategic or marketing projects, run quality checks, review cycles, or pilot tests.
- **Output**: QA/Testing and Feedback Report
