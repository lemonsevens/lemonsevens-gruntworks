# üõ†Ô∏è PROJECT SCAFFOLDING & PLANNING WORKFLOW

This document gives the step-by-step workflow for how to plan a new project using interactive prompts.

### Commands:
- `#start` ‚Äì Starts a new project by **executing the interactive prompt defined in** `operations/project-planning/vision-statement-generator.md`
- `#continue` ‚Äì Continues existing project by asking the location of the project directory and then launching the requirements gathering prompt

## 4. Methodology Selection
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/4_methodology-selection.md`
- **Purpose**: Select and document an appropriate project management methodology.
- **Goal**: Establish the methodology (Agile, Waterfall, Lean, etc.) that best suits the project type and characteristics.
- **Output**: Methodology Documentation (`methodology.md`)
- **Commands**:
  - `#generate-methodology` - Starts new methodology selection process
  - `#modify-methodology` - Allows modification of the selected methodology
  - `#methodology-status` - Shows current progress in methodology selection workflow

---

## 5. Architecture Design Generation
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/5_architecture-generator.md`
- **Purpose**: Define core architectural components for initial project scaffolding.
- **Goal**: Outline fundamental structures, patterns, and relationships.
- **Output**: Architecture Documentation (`architecture.md`), Diagram Source (`architecture/architecture.mmd`), Diagram Image (`architecture/architecture.png`)
- **Commands**:
  - `#generate-architecture` - Starts or resumes architecture design generation
  - `#architecture-status` - Shows current progress in architecture workflow

---

## 6. Initial Scaffolding Story Generation (Sprint 0)
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/6_initial-scaffolding-generator.md`
- **Purpose**: Generate focused user stories or tasks for the initial project setup (Sprint/Iteration 0).
- **Goal**: Ensure all foundational elements (environment, core structures, tooling) are properly sequenced.
- **Output**: Scaffolding Stories (`scaffolding-stories.md`)
- **Commands**:
  - `#generate-scaffold-stories` - Starts or resumes scaffolding story generation
  - `#scaffold-stories-status` - Shows current progress in story generation workflow

---

## 7. Iteration Planning & Story Generation (Sprint 1+)
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/7_full-scaffolding-generator.md`
- **Purpose**: Generate focused user stories or tasks for subsequent work iterations (Sprint/Iteration 1+).
- **Goal**: Plan the next increment of work based on requirements, architecture, and dependencies.
- **Output**: Iteration Plan (`iteration-{N}-plan.md`)
- **Commands**:
  - `#generate-iteration-plan` - Starts or resumes sprint/iteration story/task generation
  - `#iteration-plan-status` - Shows current progress in story/task generation workflow

---

## 8. Project Management Synchronization (Optional - Airtable)
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/8_project-manager.md`
- **Purpose**: Synchronize project tasks/stories with a designated Airtable base.
- **Goal**: Maintain project visibility and tracking in Airtable.
- **Output**: Updated Airtable records (`Projects` and `Tasks` tables).
- **Commands**:
  - `#push-to-airtable` - Pushes a new project and its initial tasks/stories to Airtable.
  - `#modify-airtable-task [Task Unique ID]` - Modifies a task locally and updates Airtable.
  - `#airtable-sync-status` - Shows the Airtable synchronization status.

---

## 9. Execution & Implementation (Story/Task Level)
- **Action**: Execute the interactive prompt located in `operations/project-planning/9_implementor.md`
- **Purpose**: Guide the step-by-step implementation of individual stories or tasks defined in `scaffolding-stories.md` or `iteration-{N}-plan.md`.
- **Goal**: Execute the planned work units.
- **Output**: Implemented code/deliverables, Step Plan (`[Story/Task ID]-steps.md`), Progress updates.
- **Commands**:
  - `#implement-story [Story/Task ID]` - Analyzes a story/task and breaks it into steps.
  - `#implement-next-step [Story/Task ID]` - Plans and executes the next pending step.
  - `#implementation-status [Story/Task ID]` - Shows implementation progress for a story/task.

---

## 10. Quality Assurance & Testing
- Verify that each component meets the requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Conduct appropriate testing (unit, integration, user acceptance) or quality checks.
- **Output**: QA/Testing reports, Bug fixes, Feedback logs

---

## 11. Evaluation & Continuous Improvement
- Assess project outcomes against the original vision and goals upon completion or at key milestones.
- Document lessons learned, successes, and areas for future improvement.
- **Output**: Project Evaluation Report, Retrospective notes
