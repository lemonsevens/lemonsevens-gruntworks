# Selected Project Methodology

## Methodology
-   **Name:** Agile (Kanban-like approach)
-   **Specifics/Framework:**
    *   Visual Board: Utilize Fibery for task tracking with columns such as 'To Do (PRD Features)', 'In Progress (Configuration)', 'In Review (Self-Review)', 'Done (Deployed & Validated)'.
    *   WIP (Work-In-Progress) Limits: Maintain a low WIP limit (e.g., 1-2 items) for tasks in the 'In Progress' state.
    *   Prioritization: Continuously groom and prioritize the 'To Do' backlog based on PRD requirements and dependencies.
    *   Continuous Delivery/Integration: Implement and validate Fibery components incrementally.
    *   Regular Self-Review: Periodically review implemented functionalities against the `Fibery-PRD.md` and desired operational outcomes.

## Rationale
-   Chosen based on project characteristics:
    -   Flexibility: Medium (to adapt to Fibery's specific behaviors and potential PRD nuances)
    -   Team Structure: Solo Founder (streamlined decision-making and feedback)
    -   Delivery Cadence: Incremental (allows for progressive build, test, and validation)
    -   Client Involvement: High (constant self-review and adaptation by the founder/implementor)
-   Aligns with project goals by enabling:
    *   Adaptability to tool-specific constraints discovered during implementation.
    *   Focused work by limiting concurrent tasks.
    *   Continuous validation of the Gruntworks OS as it's built within Fibery.

## Key Practices Overview
-   **Backlog Management:** Maintain a prioritized list of PRD features/configurations to be implemented.
-   **Visual Workflow Management:** Use a Kanban-style board in Fibery to track the progress of implementation tasks.
-   **WIP Limits:** Strictly limit the number of tasks being actively worked on to ensure focus and completion.
-   **Iterative Development & Self-Review:** Build and review components of the Fibery system in small, manageable increments.
-   **Continuous Improvement:** Adapt processes and plans based on learnings during the implementation.
