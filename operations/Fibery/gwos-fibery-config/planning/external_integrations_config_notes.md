# External Integrations Configuration Notes

This project relies on several external integrations, primarily managed through webhook URLs and API tokens. As per the `Fibery-PRD.md` (Section 2.14, Section 6.1) and requirements (REQ-FR-SDS-1, REQ-FR-SDS-2), these will be stored as `Config` entity records within the Fibery workspace.

## Key Configuration Points (to be stored in Fibery "Config" Entity):

1.  **`WebhookStartToken`**:
    *   Purpose: URL for the n8n webhook triggered by Fibery's "Start Focus" button.
    *   Source: To be generated by the n8n workflow.
2.  **`WebhookStopToken`**:
    *   Purpose: URL for the n8n webhook triggered by Fibery's "Stop Focus" button.
    *   Source: To be generated by the n8n workflow.
3.  **`WebhookDecompToken`**:
    *   Purpose: URL for the n8n webhook triggered by Fibery's "Decompose" button on a Project.
    *   Source: To be generated by the n8n workflow (if n8n is used for this).
4.  **`WebhookTriageToken`**:
    *   Purpose: URL for the n8n webhook triggered by Fibery's "Retry Triage" button on Inboxes.
    *   Source: To be generated by the n8n workflow.

## Other Integration Considerations:

*   **n8n Connection to Fibery API**: n8n will require Fibery API credentials (likely associated with the "Bot User") to read and write data. These credentials should be securely managed within n8n.
*   **n8n Connection to Toggl Track API**: n8n will require Toggl Track API credentials to manage timers and fetch time entries.
*   **n8n Connection to Slack API**: n8n may require Slack API credentials or use its built-in Slack nodes for sending messages.
*   **Scripts for Backups**: Any custom scripts for Fibery data/schema backups will require Fibery API credentials.

**Note:** The actual values for tokens and API keys will be provisioned during the setup and implementation of each respective integration. The `Config` entity in Fibery is the designated secure storage location for the webhook URLs accessible to Fibery buttons and automations.
