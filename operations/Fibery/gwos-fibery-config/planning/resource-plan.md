# Resource Plan Documentation

## Core Resource(s)
-   **Fibery** (Specification: `Fibery-PRD.md v1.0 – 2025-05-06`)
    -   Purpose: To serve as the central platform for the Gruntworks Operating System, managing entities, fields, workflows, automations, views, and data as per the Product Requirements Document.
    -   Chosen because: It is the explicitly defined core platform in the `Fibery-PRD.md` and the project vision.

## Supporting Resources

### 1. Automation & Integration Platform
-   Resource/Tool/Material: **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud version)
    -   Purpose: To handle webhook calls from Fibery buttons, execute external automations (e.g., AI classification for Inboxes, Time Log synchronization from Toggl), and manage complex multi-step workflows involving Fibery and other services.
    -   Chosen because: It's mentioned in the `Fibery-PRD.md` as the intended tool for external workflows, and it provides robust webhook handling, API integration capabilities, and workflow automation features necessary for the project's requirements (REQ-FR-BTN-*, REQ-FR-AUT-8).

### 2. Communication & Notification
-   Resource/Tool/Material: **Slack** (Utilizing Fibery's native integration and/or n8n)
    -   Purpose: To send notifications and alerts from Fibery automations (e.g., Scorecard Color Alert, WIP Guard DM, Priority Due Alert DM) and to deliver the Morning Digest.
    -   Chosen because: Slack is specified in the PRD for alerts and digests (REQ-FR-AUT-1, REQ-FR-AUT-5, REQ-FR-AUT-6). Fibery's native integration and n8n's Slack capabilities provide flexible options for fulfilling these requirements.

### 3. Time Tracking
-   Resource/Tool/Material: **Toggl Track**
    -   Purpose: To allow users to track time spent on tasks, initiated via Fibery's "Start/Stop Focus" buttons, with data synced back to Fibery.
    -   Chosen because: Toggl Track is specified in the `Fibery-PRD.md` (Section 4.7, TM Entity) as the source for time tracking data.

### 4. API Interaction & Data Management
-   Resource/Tool/Material: **Fibery API** (Utilized by custom scripts and/or n8n)
    -   Purpose: To enable the "Bot User" to create/edit data programmatically (REQ-FR-WCR-3) and to perform weekly data/schema backups (REQ-FR-WCR-7).
    -   Chosen because: The Fibery API is the native and necessary interface for programmatic interaction with Fibery data and schema, essential for bot actions and automated backups.

### 5. SOP Documentation & Hosting
-   Resource/Tool/Material: **GitHub** (for version control) and **MkDocs** (for static site generation)
    -   Purpose: To store, version, and present Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as a browsable website, linked from Fibery.
    -   Chosen because: The `Fibery-PRD.md` (SOP Entity) specifies linking to versioned Markdown SOPs, and GitHub with MkDocs is a standard and effective combination for this purpose.

## Integration/Alignment Notes
-   **Fibery & n8n**: Fibery buttons will trigger webhooks to n8n. n8n will use the Fibery API to read/write data (e.g., creating Time Logs, updating Inboxes). Webhook URLs generated by n8n will be stored in Fibery's `Config` entity.
-   **Fibery & Slack**: Fibery's native integration will be used for direct notifications where possible. n8n will be used for more complex Slack messages or when routing through the automation platform is required.
-   **Fibery & Toggl Track (via n8n)**: Fibery's "Start/Stop Focus" buttons trigger n8n webhooks. n8n interacts with the Toggl Track API to start/stop timers and then syncs the completed time entries to the `Time Log` entity in Fibery using the Fibery API.
-   **Fibery & GitHub/MkDocs**: SOP Links in Fibery will store URLs pointing to the MkDocs-generated static site, with content sourced from Markdown files in a GitHub repository.

## Specification Rationale
-   Adherence to `Fibery-PRD.md v1.0 – 2025-05-06` is paramount for the core Fibery setup.
-   For supporting tools (n8n, Slack, Toggl Track, GitHub, MkDocs), current stable versions are assumed. Specific API versions for integration will be determined during the implementation of those integrations, aiming for stability and feature completeness.
-   Webhook URLs and any API keys/tokens required for these integrations will be stored securely, with placeholders in Fibery's `Config` entity as specified in the PRD (e.g., `WebhookStartToken`, `WebhookStopToken`).
