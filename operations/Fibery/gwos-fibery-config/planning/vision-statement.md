# Project Vision Statement

## Purpose
This project's primary purpose is to implement the Fibery product requirements document (`Fibery-PRD.md`). This aims to realize the Gruntworks Operating System within Fibery as specified in the PRD.

## Target Audience or Beneficiaries
This project will primarily impact internal teams.

## Value Proposition
This project will set up our operational systems inside of Fibery.

## Key Components or Deliverables
- Workspace Configuration & Roles
- All defined Entities & Fields
- Fibery Buttons
- Fibery Automations
- Views & Dashboards
- Seed Data & Setup Steps

## Future Vision
If successful, this project will have a broad impact:
- **Foundation for Scalable Operations:** This Fibery implementation will serve as the central nervous system for Gruntworks, enabling efficient scaling of all operations (Sell, Ship, Strategy, Systems, Support) as the business grows, supporting more complex projects and potentially larger teams with consistent processes.
- **Enhanced Data-Driven Decision Making:** By centralizing all operational data and workflows, the Fibery workspace will provide deep insights into performance, bottlenecks, and opportunities, fostering proactive, data-informed strategic decisions across all facets of the business.
- **Exemplar of Operational Excellence:** The fully realized Gruntworks OS in Fibery could become a showcase of operational best practices, potentially serving as a model or even a template for advising clients or developing related products/services.
- **Platform for Continuous Improvement & Automation:** This system will not be static; it will be the platform upon which further automations are built and processes are continuously refined, leading to ever-increasing efficiency and effectiveness in delivering value.
