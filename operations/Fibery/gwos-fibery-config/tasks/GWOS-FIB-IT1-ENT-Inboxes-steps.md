# GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Inboxes: Implement Inbox Entities (EIN, IIN) in Systems Space - Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to verify and align the `External Inbox (EIN)` and `Internal Inbox (IIN)` Fibery databases within the `Systems` Space with their PRD specifications, as part of Iteration 1 of the GWOS Fibery setup.

## Task Objective
As the Founder, I want to create the `External Inbox (EIN)` and `Internal Inbox (IIN)` Fibery databases within the `Systems` Space, with all their specified fields, so that raw inputs can be captured systematically.

## Relevant PRD Sections
-   PRD Section 2.9: External Inbox (EIN) *and* Internal Inbox (IIN)
-   PRD Section 2.1: Database Summary (for entity codes)

## Prerequisites
-   Fibery workspace "Gruntworks OS (Production)" is accessible.
-   Owner-level access to the Fibery workspace.
-   The `Systems` Fibery space exists.
-   The `External_Inbox` (for EIN) and `Internal_Inbox` (for IIN) databases exist in the `Systems` space (as confirmed by user and post-Sprint 0 check).
-   API Token for `fibery-bot` user.
-   `fibery_api_guide.md` and `Fibery-PRD.md` for reference.

## Deliverables
1.  `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.9.
2.  `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.9.
3.  Necessary fields for EIN and IIN created or updated via API calls if discrepancies are found and automatable (unlikely for these simple types if they already exist as per user confirmation).
4.  Relation to `Task (TSK)` for `Created Task` field verified.
5.  This step-by-step plan is updated with all actions and verification checks.

## Steps

**Step 1: Get Current Schema for `Systems` Space & Analyze `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Executed `mcp_fibery-mcp-graphql_get_schema_sdl` for the `Systems` space.
    2.  Extracted the field definitions for the `SystemsExternalInbox` type (representing `External Inbox (EIN)`).
    3.  Compared these fields against PRD Section 2.9. Analysis summary:
        *   All fields specified in PRD 2.9 for `External Inbox (EIN)` have a corresponding field name in the `SystemsExternalInbox` schema (e.g., PRD `Source` -> schema `source`, PRD `Raw Text` -> schema `rawText`).
        *   All custom fields (`source`, `rawText`, `labels`, `processed`, `createdTask`) are currently `String` type in the schema and will require manual UI adjustment to match specific PRD types (Enum, Rich Text, Multi-select, Checkbox, Relation) and options/defaults.
- Verification:
    - [X] GraphQL schema for `Systems` space retrieved and analyzed.
    - [X] Analysis of `Systems/External_Inbox` fields against PRD 2.9 documented.

**Step 2: Create/Update Fields for `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (API actions performed; some manual UI adjustments remain)
- Action:
    1.  Based on the analysis from Step 1, the following fields in `SystemsExternalInbox` required type changes. The `Systems/Source` field was left for manual UI adjustment due to complexities with deleting its existing Enum structure with data.
        *   `Systems/Source`: (Manual UI) String to Enum (Options: Email; Slack; API). User to ensure field type is Enum, options are correct, and delete old/incorrect option entities from the backing type `Systems/Source_Systems/External Inbox` if necessary.
        *   `Systems/RawText`: Deleted String field, recreated as Rich Text (`Collaboration~Documents/Document`).
        *   `Systems/Labels`: Deleted String field, recreated as Text. (Manual UI) User to change type to Multi-select and add options.
        *   `Systems/Processed`: Deleted String field, recreated as Checkbox (`fibery/bool`, default: false).
        *   `Systems/CreatedTask`: Deleted String field, recreated as Relation to `Ship/Task`.
    2.  `temp_payload_EIN_delete.json` executed to delete `RawText`, `Labels`, `Processed`, `CreatedTask`.
    3.  `temp_payload_EIN_recreate.json` executed to recreate these four fields.
- Verification:
    - [X] `curl` for field deletion successful (for the four fields).
    - [X] `curl` for field recreation successful (for the four fields).
    - [X] GraphQL schema for `Systems` space confirms:
        *   `SystemsExternalInbox.createdTask` is type `ShipTask`.
        *   `SystemsExternalInbox.processed` is type `Boolean`.
        *   `SystemsExternalInbox.rawText` is type `RichField` (assumed from API success for `Collaboration~Documents/Document`).
        *   `SystemsExternalInbox.labels` is type `String` (placeholder for manual UI change to Multi-select).
        *   `SystemsExternalInbox.source` remains `SystemsSourceSystemsExternalInbox` (Enum, requires manual UI check/cleanup of options).

**Step 3: Analyze Existing `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete (Analysis from Step 1 applies here due to identical structure)
- Action:
    1.  Using the schema from Step 1, the field structure for `SystemsInternalInbox` is identical to `SystemsExternalInbox` prior to modifications. The same fields (`source`, `rawText`, `labels`, `processed`, `createdTask`) require type changes.
- Verification:
    - [X] Confirmed `SystemsInternalInbox` requires the same field recreations as `SystemsExternalInbox`.

**Step 4: Create/Update Fields for `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (API actions performed; some manual UI adjustments remain)
- Action:
    1.  The following fields in `SystemsInternalInbox` were targeted for type changes. `Systems/Source` and `Systems/Labels` were created as Text placeholders for manual UI conversion.
        *   `Systems/Source`: Deleted String field, recreated as Text. (Manual UI) User to change type to Single Select (Enum) and add options: Meeting; Direct Input; System Alert.
        *   `Systems/RawText`: Deleted String field, recreated as Rich Text (`Collaboration~Documents/Document`).
        *   `Systems/Labels`: Deleted String field, recreated as Text. (Manual UI) User to change type to Multi-select and add options.
        *   `Systems/Processed`: Deleted String field, recreated as Checkbox (`fibery/bool`, default: false).
        *   `Systems/CreatedTask`: Deleted String field, recreated as Relation to `Ship/Task`.
    2.  `temp_payload_IIN_delete.json` executed to delete the five original String fields.
    3.  `temp_payload_IIN_recreate_simplified.json` executed to recreate these five fields with new types/placeholders.
- Verification:
    - [X] `curl` for IIN field deletion successful.
    - [X] `curl` for IIN field recreation successful.
    - [X] GraphQL schema for `Systems` space confirms for `SystemsInternalInbox`:
        *   `createdTask` is type `ShipTask`.
        *   `processed` is type `Boolean`.
        *   `rawText` is type `RichField` (inferred).
        *   `labels` is type `String` (placeholder for manual UI change to Multi-select).
        *   `source` is type `String` (placeholder for manual UI change to Enum).

**Step 5: Verify `Created Task` Relation for EIN and IIN**
- Status: [X] Complete (Covered by field recreation in Steps 2 & 4)
- Action:
    1.  The `Systems/CreatedTask` field for both EIN and IIN will be recreated as a proper Relation to `Ship/Task` in Steps 2 and 4.
- Verification:
    - [X] Verification will occur after field recreation in Steps 2 and 4 by inspecting the new schema.

**Step 6: Final Verification & Task Completion**
- Status: [X] Complete (API actions performed; manual UI adjustments pending by user)
- Action:
    1.  Reviewed all deliverables for task `GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Inboxes`.
    2.  PRD-specified fields for EIN & IIN requiring API changes have been addressed (delete/recreate). `RawText`, `Processed`, and `CreatedTask` fields are now correctly typed. `Source` (EIN), `Source` (IIN), `Labels` (EIN), and `Labels` (IIN) require manual UI type changes and option configuration by the user as detailed in chat and step updates.
    3.  This steps file is updated with completion status for API-related checks and actions.
    4.  Temporary payload files will be deleted in the next step.
- Verification:
    - [X] All deliverables met from an automated analysis and structural verification perspective for API-modifiable fields.
    - [X] `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) and `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) have fields `RawText`, `Processed`, and `CreatedTask` correctly typed. `Source` and `Labels` fields for both are text placeholders requiring manual UI configuration by the user.
