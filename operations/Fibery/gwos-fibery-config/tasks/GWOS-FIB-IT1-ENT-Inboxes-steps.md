# GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Inboxes: Implement Inbox Entities (EIN, IIN) in Systems Space - Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to verify and align the `External Inbox (EIN)` and `Internal Inbox (IIN)` Fibery databases within the `Systems` Space with their PRD specifications, as part of Iteration 1 of the GWOS Fibery setup.

## Task Objective
As the Founder, I want to create the `External Inbox (EIN)` and `Internal Inbox (IIN)` Fibery databases within the `Systems` Space, with all their specified fields, so that raw inputs can be captured systematically.

## Relevant PRD Sections
-   PRD Section 2.9: External Inbox (EIN) *and* Internal Inbox (IIN)
-   PRD Section 2.1: Database Summary (for entity codes)

## Prerequisites
-   Fibery workspace "Gruntworks OS (Production)" is accessible.
-   Owner-level access to the Fibery workspace.
-   The `Systems` Fibery space exists.
-   The `External_Inbox` (for EIN) and `Internal_Inbox` (for IIN) databases exist in the `Systems` space (as confirmed by user and post-Sprint 0 check).
-   API Token for `fibery-bot` user.
-   `fibery_api_guide.md` and `Fibery-PRD.md` for reference.

## Deliverables
1.  `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.9.
2.  `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.9.
3.  Necessary fields for EIN and IIN created or updated via API calls if discrepancies are found and automatable (unlikely for these simple types if they already exist as per user confirmation).
4.  Relation to `Task (TSK)` for `Created Task` field verified.
5.  This step-by-step plan is updated with all actions and verification checks.

## Steps

**Step 1: Get Current Schema for `Systems` Space & Analyze `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Executed `mcp_fibery-mcp-graphql_get_schema_sdl` for the `Systems` space.
    2.  Extracted the field definitions for the `SystemsExternalInbox` type (representing `External Inbox (EIN)`).
    3.  Compared these fields against PRD Section 2.9. Analysis summary:
        *   All fields specified in PRD 2.9 for `External Inbox (EIN)` have a corresponding field name in the `SystemsExternalInbox` schema (e.g., PRD `Source` -> schema `source`, PRD `Raw Text` -> schema `rawText`).
        *   All custom fields (`source`, `rawText`, `labels`, `processed`, `createdTask`) are currently `String` type in the schema and will require manual UI adjustment to match specific PRD types (Enum, Rich Text, Multi-select, Checkbox, Relation) and options/defaults.
- Verification:
    - [X] GraphQL schema for `Systems` space retrieved and analyzed.
    - [X] Analysis of `Systems/External_Inbox` fields against PRD 2.9 documented.

**Step 2: Create/Update Fields for `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (No API action needed for field creation; verification and noting discrepancies is key)
- Action:
    1.  Based on the analysis from Step 1, all PRD-specified fields for `External Inbox (EIN)` already exist by name in the `SystemsExternalInbox` schema.
    2.  No new fields need to be created via API for `SystemsExternalInbox`.
    3.  Type adjustments are manual UI tasks for the user: `source` (to Enum + options), `rawText` (to Rich Text), `labels` (to Multi-select), `processed` (to Checkbox + default), `createdTask` (to Relation to Task).
- Verification:
    - [X] Confirmed all PRD field names exist in `SystemsExternalInbox`. Discrepancies in type require manual UI changes.

**Step 3: Analyze Existing `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Using the schema from Step 1, extracted the field definitions for the `SystemsInternalInbox` type (representing `Internal Inbox (IIN)`).
    2.  Comparison against PRD Section 2.9 shows an identical structure and field list to `SystemsExternalInbox`. Analysis summary:
        *   All fields specified in PRD 2.9 for `Internal Inbox (IIN)` have a corresponding field name in the `SystemsInternalInbox` schema.
        *   All custom fields are currently `String` type and will require manual UI adjustment as with EIN.
- Verification:
    - [X] Analysis of `Systems/Internal_Inbox` fields against PRD 2.9 documented, confirming similarity to EIN.

**Step 4: Create/Update Fields for `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (No API action needed for field creation; verification and noting discrepancies is key)
- Action:
    1.  Based on the analysis from Step 3, all PRD-specified fields for `Internal Inbox (IIN)` already exist by name in the `SystemsInternalInbox` schema.
    2.  No new fields need to be created via API for `SystemsInternalInbox`.
    3.  Type adjustments are manual UI tasks for the user, identical to EIN: `source` (to Enum + options), `rawText` (to Rich Text), `labels` (to Multi-select), `processed` (to Checkbox + default), `createdTask` (to Relation to Task).
- Verification:
    - [X] Confirmed all PRD field names exist in `SystemsInternalInbox`. Discrepancies in type require manual UI changes.

**Step 5: Verify `Created Task` Relation for EIN and IIN**
- Status: [X] Complete (Verification done, manual UI adjustment needed)
- Action:
    1.  PRD Section 2.9 specifies an optional `Created Task` relation (to TSK) for both EIN and IIN.
    2.  Checked the existing GraphQL schema (from Step 1) for `SystemsExternalInbox` and `SystemsInternalInbox`.
        *   Both types have a field named `createdTask` which is currently of type `String`.
    3.  This field needs to be manually changed in the Fibery UI to a Relation type, pointing to the `Ship/Task` database.
- Verification:
    - [X] `Created Task` field name exists on both `Systems/External_Inbox` and `Systems/Internal_Inbox`.
    - [X] Field type is currently `String` and requires manual UI change to a Relation to `Ship/Task`.

**Step 6: Final Verification & Task Completion**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Reviewed all deliverables for task `GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Inboxes`.
    2.  All PRD-specified fields for `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) & `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN), including the `Created Task` field, are structurally present by name as confirmed by GraphQL schema analysis. Necessary type refinements (Enum, Rich Text, Multi-select, Checkbox, Relation) are noted as manual UI tasks.
    3.  This steps file is updated with completion status for all checks and actions.
- Verification:
    - [X] All deliverables met from an automated analysis and structural verification perspective (field names exist).
    - [X] `Systems/External_Inbox` (EIN) and `Systems/Internal_Inbox` (IIN) are structurally sound by field name. User to perform manual UI adjustments for all field types and options.
