# GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Crm: Implement CRM Entities (CLI, DLR) in Sales Space - Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to create/verify the `Client (CLI)` and `Deal (DLR)` Fibery databases within the `Sales` Space, ensuring all their specified fields are present and basic relations are established, as per Iteration 1 of the GWOS Fibery setup.

## Task Objective
As the Founder, I want to create the `Client (CLI)` and `Deal (DLR)` Fibery databases within the `Sales` Space, with all their specified fields and establish basic relations between them and to existing core entities, so that foundational CRM capabilities are in place.

## Relevant PRD Sections
-   PRD Section 2.7: Client (CLI)
-   PRD Section 2.8: Deal (DLR)
-   PRD Section 2.1: Database Summary (for entity codes)

## Prerequisites
-   Fibery workspace "Gruntworks OS (Production)" is accessible.
-   Owner-level access to the Fibery workspace.
-   The `Sales` Fibery space exists.
-   The `Company` (for CLI) and `Deal` (for DLR) databases likely exist in the `Sales` space, as per the post-Sprint 0 check.
-   API Token for `fibery-bot` user.
-   `fibery_api_guide.md` and `Fibery-PRD.md` for reference.

## Deliverables
1.  `Sales/Company` (CLI) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.7 (key fields & types).
2.  `Sales/Deal` (DLR) database schema verified and aligned with PRD Section 2.8 (key fields & types).
3.  Necessary fields for CLI and DLR created or updated via API calls if discrepancies found.
4.  Basic relations for CLI (to Projects, to Deals) and DLR (to Client) established/verified.
5.  This step-by-step plan is updated with all actions and verification checks.

## Steps

**Step 1: Get Current Schema for `Sales` Space & Analyze `Sales/Company` (CLI) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Executed `mcp_fibery-mcp-graphql_get_schema_sdl` for the `Sales` space.
    2.  Extracted the field definitions for the `SalesCompany` type (representing `Client (CLI)`).
    3.  Compared these fields against PRD Section 2.7 (`Client (CLI)`). Analysis summary:
        *   All fields specified in PRD 2.7 for `Client (CLI)` have a corresponding field in the `SalesCompany` schema (e.g., PRD `Name` -> schema `name`, PRD `Tier` -> schema `tier`).
        *   Existing schema types for `website` (String), `tier` (String), `Contact Email`/`email` (String), `Contact Phone`/`contactPhone` (String), and `Status`/`status` (String) will require manual UI adjustment to match specific PRD types (URL, Enum with options, Email, Phone).
        *   Relations `Deals` and `Projects` are present.
- Verification:
    - [X] GraphQL schema for `Sales` space retrieved and analyzed.
    - [X] Analysis of `SalesCompany` fields against PRD 2.7 documented.

**Step 2: Create/Update Fields for `Sales/Company` (CLI) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (No API action needed for field creation)
- Action:
    1.  Based on the analysis from Step 1, all PRD-specified fields for `Client (CLI)` already exist in the `SalesCompany` schema.
    2.  No new fields need to be created via API for `SalesCompany` at this stage.
    3.  Type adjustments (e.g., String to Enum, String to URL/Email/Phone) and adding Enum options are manual UI tasks for the user after this automated setup.
- Verification:
    - [X] Confirmed no missing fields requiring API creation for `SalesCompany`.
    - [X] User to manually adjust field types (Website: URL; Tier: Enum + options A,B,C; Contact Email: Email; Contact Phone: Phone; Status: Enum + options Prospect,Active,Past) and add Enum options in the Fibery UI as a follow-up.

**Step 3: Analyze Existing `Sales/Deal` (DLR) Fields**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Using the schema from Step 1, extracted the field definitions for the `SalesDeal` type (representing `Deal (DLR)`).
    2.  Compared these fields against PRD Section 2.8 (`Deal (DLR)`). Analysis summary:
        *   All fields specified in PRD 2.8 for `Deal (DLR)` have a corresponding field in the `SalesDeal` schema (e.g., PRD `Name` -> schema `name`, PRD `Stage` -> schema `stage`).
        *   Existing schema types for `Amount`/`amount` (Float), `Stage`/`stage` (String), `Close Date`/`closeDate` (String), `Owner`/`owner` (String), and `Notes`/`notes` (String) will require manual UI adjustment to match specific PRD types (Currency, Enum with options, Date, User, Rich Text) and default values.
        *   Relation `Client` is present.
- Verification:
    - [X] Analysis of `SalesDeal` fields against PRD 2.8 documented.

**Step 4: Create/Update Fields for `Sales/Deal` (DLR) if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete (No API action needed for field creation)
- Action:
    1.  Based on the analysis from Step 3, all PRD-specified fields for `Deal (DLR)` already exist in the `SalesDeal` schema.
    2.  No new fields need to be created via API for `SalesDeal` at this stage.
    3.  Type adjustments (e.g., Float to Currency, String to Enum/Date/User/Rich Text) and adding Enum options/defaults are manual UI tasks for the user.
- Verification:
    - [X] Confirmed no missing fields requiring API creation for `SalesDeal`.
    - [X] User to manually adjust field types (Amount: Currency + USD default; Stage: Enum + options; Close Date: Date; Owner: User + Founder default; Notes: Rich Text) and add Enum options/defaults in the Fibery UI as a follow-up.

**Step 5: Define and Implement/Verify Relations for CLI and DLR**
- Status: [X] Complete (No API action needed for relation creation)
- Action:
    1.  Identified required relations from PRD:
        *   `Client (CLI)` to `Project (PRJ)` (n-to-many) - PRD field `Projects` on CLI.
        *   `Client (CLI)` to `Deal (DLR)` (n-to-many) - PRD field `Deals` on CLI.
        *   `Deal (DLR)` to `Client (CLI)` (many-to-one, required) - PRD field `Client` on DLR.
    2.  Checked the existing GraphQL schema for `Sales` space:
        *   `SalesCompany` (CLI) has a field `projects: [ShipProject]`, fulfilling CLI-to-PRJ.
        *   `SalesCompany` (CLI) has a field `deals: [SalesDeal]`, fulfilling CLI-to-DLR.
        *   `SalesDeal` (DLR) has a field `client: SalesCompany`, fulfilling DLR-to-CLI.
    3.  All required basic relations are already present in the schema.
- Verification:
    - [X] Analysis of required vs. existing relations shows all necessary relations are structurally present.
    - [X] No API calls needed to create these relations.
    - [X] User to visually verify relations in Fibery UI if desired (e.g., ensure a Deal can be linked to a Company, and a Company can show linked Projects and Deals).

**Step 6: Final Verification & Task Completion**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Reviewed all deliverables for task `GWOS-FIB-IT1-ENT-Crm`.
    2.  All PRD-specified fields for `Sales/Company` (CLI) & `Sales/Deal` (DLR) and their basic relations are structurally present as confirmed by GraphQL schema analysis. Necessary type refinements (Enum, Currency, etc.) are noted as manual UI tasks.
    3.  This steps file is updated with completion status for all checks and actions.
    4.  No temporary payload files were created or used for this task.
- Verification:
    - [X] All deliverables met from an automated analysis and structural verification perspective.
    - [X] `Sales/Company` (CLI) and `Sales/Deal` (DLR) are structurally sound. User to perform manual UI adjustments for field types and options.
