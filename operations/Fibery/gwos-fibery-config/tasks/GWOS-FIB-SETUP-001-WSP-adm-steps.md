[X] 1.  **Access Fibery Workspace:** Log in to the Fibery account that will host the "Gruntworks OS (Production)" workspace.
2.  **Verify/Set Workspace Name (Deliverable 1):**
    *   Check if a workspace named "Gruntworks OS (Production)" already exists.
    *   If it exists, confirm it's the correct one.
    *   If it doesn't exist, or if a different one is intended, create/rename the workspace to "Gruntworks OS (Production)".
    *   *Verification (Check 1 part 1):* Confirm workspace name in settings.
[X] 3.  **Verify Owner Role Capabilities (Deliverable 2):**
    *   As the logged-in user (assuming this user is the designated Owner), navigate to workspace administration/settings areas.
    *   Confirm ability to access schema editor, user management, and other administrative functions.
    *   *Verification (Check 1 part 2):* Confirm access to admin settings.
[X] 4.  **Invite/Create Bot User (Deliverable 3):**
    *   Invite or create a new user (e.g., `fibery-bot@yourcompany.com`) to serve as the "Bot User".
    *   *Verification (Check 2):* Confirm Bot User is present in the user list.
[ ] 5.  **Define Contractor Role (Deliverable 4):**
    *   Create a new role "Contractor Role".
    *   Configure permissions: Can view/edit assigned Tasks; cannot access schema or Config entity.
    *   *Verification (Check 3):* Confirm role existence and basic permission shell.
[X] 6.  **Confirm Audit Log Enabled (Deliverable 5):**
    *   Verify in workspace settings that audit logging is enabled for all create/update operations.
    *   Optionally, perform a test entity creation/update and check the audit log.
    *   *Verification (Check 4):* Confirm audit log setting is enabled.
7.  **Perform Audit Log Test (Verification Check 4 part 2):**
    *   Create a temporary test entity in any existing or a new test database.
    *   Update a field in the test entity.
    *   Delete the test entity.
    *   If audit logs are directly viewable in Fibery UI, check for these create/update/delete actions. If not directly viewable, this check relies on confirming the setting in step 6. 

*   **Overall Status:** Partially Complete (Step 5 Deferred). All other steps and verifications for GWOS-FIB-SETUP-001-WSP-adm are complete as of current date.
*   **Next Action:** Proceed to GWOS-FIB-SETUP-002-CFG-ent.
