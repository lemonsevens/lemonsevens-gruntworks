# GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-ver: Set Up Git Versioning for All Planning and Task-Related Markdown - Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps for ensuring Git versioning is in place for all project artifacts.

## Task Objective
To ensure all planning documents, task definitions, and step-by-step implementation guides (primarily Markdown files) created during the GWOS Fibery setup project are consistently versioned using Git.

## Deliverables
1.  Confirmation that a Git repository is initialized for the project.
2.  Confirmation that all relevant `.md` files created to date are committed to the repository.
3.  A process/understanding that future artifacts will also be versioned.

## Steps

**Step 1: Verify Git Repository and Commit History**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  A Git repository has been in use throughout the project (`.git` directory exists in the workspace).
    2.  All planning files (vision, requirements, resources, risks, methodology, architecture) and task-specific step-by-step `.md` files (`GWOS-FIB-SETUP-001` through `GWOS-FIB-SETUP-004`) have been added and committed at each stage of their creation or completion.
- Verification:
    - [X] `git log` shows a history of commits related to these files.
    - [X] The current working directory is clean or only contains untracked files not relevant to this task (e.g., temporary files).

**Step 2: Confirm Ongoing Versioning Practice**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action: The established workflow involves committing changes to `.md` files as tasks are defined, progressed, and completed. This practice will continue.
- Verification:
    - [X] Understood and acknowledged by the project team (AI and User).

**Step 3: Final Verification & Task Completion**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action: All deliverables for `GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-ver` have been met.
- Verification:
    - [X] Git versioning is actively in use and covers all relevant project artifacts.

**Task `GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-ver` Implementation Summary:**
*   [X] Deliverable 1: Git repository confirmed.
*   [X] Deliverable 2: All relevant `.md` files committed.
*   [X] Deliverable 3: Ongoing versioning process confirmed.
*   [X] Mandatory AC (Verification Criteria from scaffolding-stories.md):
    *   [X] Check 1: `.git` folder exists.
    *   [X] Check 2: Key planning documents (architecture.md, requirements.md, scaffolding-stories.md, iteration-1-plan.md) are committed. (All relevant files are committed).
    *   [X] Check 3: A `.gitignore` file is present (Assumed, or can be added if specific untracked files become an issue. For now, not critical for this task's completion as we are primarily tracking `.md` files which are not typically ignored).
