# GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-cfg: Initialize Git for Project Configuration - Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to ensure the project's Fibery configuration and planning documents are properly version controlled in the specified Git repository.

## Task Objective
To verify and ensure that the `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/` directory and its contents are managed under Git, connected to the correct remote repository, and that key planning files are committed.

## Steps

**Step 1: Verify Git Repository Status for `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/`**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Navigate to the workspace root (`/home/stacks/wsl/other/gruntworks`).
    2.  Run `git status operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/` to check if the directory is tracked and its current status.
    3.  Run `git remote -v` to check existing remote repositories.
- Verification:
    - [X] Command outputs confirm the directory is part of a Git working tree.
    - [X] Command output shows a remote named `origin` pointing to `https://github.com/lemonsevens/lemonsevens-gruntworks.git` (fetch/push).
- Notes: This step confirms Deliverable D1. Deliverable D4 specifies remote `https://github.com/lemonsevens/gruntworks.git`; current remote is `https://github.com/lemonsevens/lemonsevens-gruntworks.git`. Assuming current remote is functionally correct for now. Untracked files present, including the `planning/` directory and other task files.

**Step 2: Check for and Create `.gitignore` if Necessary**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  Check if `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/.gitignore` exists. (Done - did not exist)
    2.  If not, evaluate if one is needed (e.g., for `temp_*.json` files or other temporary artifacts if they are frequently generated and not cleaned up). Given `temp_fibery_payload.json` is typically deleted, a `.gitignore` might be minimal or not strictly needed for current workflow, but good practice to consider. (Done - deemed useful)
    3.  If deemed necessary, create `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/.gitignore` with appropriate patterns (e.g., `temp_*.json`). (Done)
- Execution (if creating):
    - `default_api.edit_file` to create `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/.gitignore`. (Done)
    - Content:
      ```
      # Temporary files
      temp_*.json
      *.tmp

      # OS-generated files
      .DS_Store
      Thumbs.db
      ```
- Verification:
    - [X] `.gitignore` file exists if created.
    - [X] Its content is appropriate for the project's needs (e.g., ignores temporary files).
- Notes: This step addresses Deliverable D2. Created a `.gitignore` to ignore `temp_*.json` and common OS files.

**Step 3: Verify Commit Status of Planning Files**
- Status: [X] Complete
- Action:
    1.  List the planning files specified in `scaffolding-stories.md` (D3 for GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005):
        *   `vision-statement.md`
        *   `requirements.md`
        *   `resource-plan.md`
        *   `architecture.md`
        *   `architecture.mmd`
        *   `methodology.md`
        *   `risk-register.md`
        (These should be in `operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/planning/`) (Done)
    2.  Run `git log --oneline -- operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/planning/filename.md` for each file to see if they have been committed. (Skipped due to untracked status)
    3.  Alternatively, run `git status operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/planning/` to see if any of these files are untracked or have uncommitted changes. (Done - directory was untracked)
    4.  Add untracked planning files: `git add operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/planning/` (Done)
- Verification:
    - [X] All listed planning files are confirmed to be tracked and committed to the repository. (Files are now staged for commit)
- Notes: This addresses Deliverable D3. The `planning/` directory was untracked and has been added to staging. It includes all specified files plus `external_integrations_config_notes.md`.

**Step 4: Final Actions & Commit**
- Status: [ ] Pending
- Action:
    1.  If `.gitignore` was created/modified, add and commit it.
    2.  Update this `GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-cfg-steps.md` file with outcomes.
    3.  Commit the `GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-cfg-steps.md` file.
- Execution:
    - `git add operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/.gitignore` (if changed)
    - `git commit -m "feat(fibery): Configure .gitignore for Fibery config anax d update GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005 steps"` (or similar)
    - `git add operations/Fibery/gwos-fibery-config/tasks/GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005-GIT-cfg-steps.md`
    - `git commit -m "docs(fibery): Complete GWOS-FIB-SETUP-005 Git configuration task"`
- Verification:
    - [ ] All relevant changes committed. Task marked complete.
- Notes: This task is primarily a verification task if Git has been used consistently.
