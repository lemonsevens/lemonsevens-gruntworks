# üõ†Ô∏è TASK MASTER: PROJECT PLANNER TOOL

This document provides instructions on how to use the interactive project planning workflow facilitated by specialized AI prompts. The workflow guides you through defining, planning, and setting up a project step-by-step.

## Overview

The workflow consists of several phases, each managed by a specific prompt file located in the `TASK-MASTER` directory. You interact with the workflow by issuing commands (hashtags) in your chat interface. Each phase builds upon the outputs of the previous ones, creating a comprehensive set of planning documents.

## Getting Started

To begin planning a new project, use the `#start` command, which initiates the Vision & Goals Definition phase.

```
#start
```

To continue working on an existing project where some planning documents already exist, use the `#continue` command. You will be prompted for the project directory location.

```
#continue
```

## Workflow Phases & Commands

Below are the phases of the project planning workflow and the primary commands used to interact with each phase. Status commands (`#<phase>-status`) are generally available to check progress within a phase. Modification commands (`#modify-<phase>`) allow revisiting and changing outputs.

*Note: The tool now supports more granular project types (e.g., Web Application, Marketing Campaign) which tailor resource suggestions, architecture templates, and task generation.* 

**Overall Project Commands:**
- `#start`: Initiate planning for a new project (Starts Phase 1).
- `#continue`: Resume planning for an existing project.
- `#project-summary`: Generate/update a `PROJECT_README.md` file in the project root summarizing the status based on planning artifacts (Phase 11).

    - `#architecture-status`: Check progress on architecture design.

---

**Phase 6: Initial Scaffolding Story Generation (Sprint 0)**
- **Purpose**: Create tasks/stories for the foundational project setup (environment, core structures) using templates specific to the project type. Tasks include mandatory verification criteria (e.g., unit tests, success metrics).

- **Prompt File**: `TASK-MASTER/7_full-scaffolding-generator.md`
- **Output**: `iteration-{N}-plan.md`
- **Commands**:
    - `#generate-iteration-plan`: Start planning stories/tasks for the next iteration.
    - `#iteration-plan-status`: Check progress on iteration planning.

---

**Phase 8: Project Management Synchronization (Optional - Airtable)**
