## STEP 6 ‚Äì Vision Statement Generation

Using the above answers, generate a markdown-formatted vision statement in this format:

```markdown
# Project Vision Statement

## Purpose  
[Insert from Step 1]

## Target Audience or Beneficiaries  
[Insert from Step 2]

## Value Proposition  
[Insert from Step 3]

## Key Components or Deliverables  
[Insert from Step 4]

## Future Vision  
[Insert from Step 5]
```

Then prompt the user:

"Please review the vision statement. Reply with:
- 'approved' to proceed with saving
- or specify changes you'd like to see."

[STOP ‚Äî Wait for approval or revision instructions]

---

## STEP 7 ‚Äì Saving & Status Update

Once approved:

```plaintext
Would you like to save this vision statement? (Yes/No)
```

If the user answers 'Yes':

1.  **Infer Appropriate Business Section:** Analyze the vision statement's content (Purpose, Target Audience, Value Proposition) to decide the most appropriate root directory (`operations/`, `business/`, `marketing/`, `sales/`, `product/`) or create a new one if none match.
2.  **Create Project Directory:** Infer a concise project directory name from the Purpose statement. Navigate into the chosen business section directory and create this new project subdirectory. Let's call the full path `[project_directory_path]`.
3.  **Create Standard Subdirectories:** Inside the newly created project directory, create the following subdirectories:
    - `planning/` (For vision, requirements, resources, methodology, architecture docs)
    - `tasks/` (For scaffolding stories, iteration plans, implementation steps)
    - `assets/` (For generated outputs, code, deliverables during implementation)
4.  **Save File:** Save the generated markdown vision statement as `vision-statement.md` inside the `planning/` subdirectory: `[project_directory_path]/planning/vision-statement.md`.

After saving:

```plaintext
Project directory created at: [project_directory_path]
Standard subdirectories created: planning/, tasks/, assets/
Vision statement saved to: [project_directory_path]/planning/vision-statement.md

You can modify this vision later using #modify-vision
```

---

## `#vision-status` Command Response:

```plaintext
Vision Statement Progress:
‚úì Completed: [list completed steps]
‚ßñ Current: [current step and what's needed to proceed]
‚òê Remaining: [list uncompleted steps]

Use #generate-vision to start a new vision
Use #modify-vision to adjust an existing vision
```

---

## Rules:

1. Never skip [STOP] prompts or continue without user input  
2. Stay focused on **WHAT**, not **HOW**  
3. Separate technical solutions from strategic goals  
4. Make sure the vision aligns with actual project objectives  
5. Don't make assumptions about implementation  
6. Center on value to the user/stakeholder, not internal processes  
7. Document each user input clearly and consistently  
8. Maintain formatting consistency throughout  
9. Always require user approval before moving forward
