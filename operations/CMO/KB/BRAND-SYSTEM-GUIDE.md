## 3. BRAND IDENTITY

### 3.1. Logo

#### Visual Overview
Imagine a sturdy, truncated-hexagon badge on a work boot—rendered in a charcoal-black field. Centered across that badge, the word GRUNTWORKS appears in heavy, stencil-style uppercase, its off-white letters carrying a subtle, grainy distress like "industrial grit". Above the name, a row of stylized green grass blades arcs gently, and below it a textured mound of earth/soil sits as a visual foundation, with the tagline "Growing Landscaping Companies" appearing in safety orange. There is a subtle, distressed texture across the entire logo.

#### Logo Composition
*   **Badge Base:** Truncated-hexagon with softly rounded corners. In each corner are small circular cutouts that resemble rivet holes. Conveys protection, authority and an industrial badge aesthetic.
*   **Logotype: "GRUNTWORKS":** Bold, stencil-style uppercase. Off-white fill with a light distress texture for an authentic, "worked-in" feel.
*   **Grass Silhouette (Top):** A row of simplified blades forming a gentle arch. Symbolizes the brand's focus on growth and green-industry expertise.
*   **Soil Mound (Bottom):** Rough, uneven texture suggesting freshly turned earth. Grounds the design literally and metaphorically.
*   **Tagline (inside the soil mound):** Safety orange, Mohave font, bold.

#### Texture & Finish Notes
*   **Distressed Overlay:** Fine speckle across all elements to mimic wear, paint chips and dirt.
This distressed overlay texture is applied *only* to the primary Badge Logo and the Wordmark + Grass Logo variations. The Wordmark Logo and Emblem Logo variations do not use this texture.
*   **Bevel & Emboss:** Subtle edge embossing on the badge to add dimensionality, like a metal plate.
*   **Contrast:** High-contrast typography (Cream White on Charcoal) for instant legibility in any application.

#### Brand Takeaway
The combined effect of strong geometry, organic motifs and textured grit positions Gruntworks as a no-nonsense partner—hard-working, reliable and deeply rooted in the real world of landscaping operations.

#### Clear Space

To ensure the logo's visibility and impact, always maintain a minimum clear space around it. This exclusion zone should be free of text, graphics, or other elements that might clutter or compete with the logo.

*   **Badge Logo & Emblem Logo:** The minimum clear space is defined by half the height of the primary "GRUNTWORKS" logotype within the badge or emblem.
*   **Wordmark Logo & Wordmark + Grass Logo:** The minimum clear space is defined by the height of the letter "G" in "GRUNTWORKS".

![Placeholder for Clear Space Diagram] *(Suggestion: Add a simple diagram illustrating the clear space rule for the primary badge logo)*

#### Minimum Size

To ensure legibility and brand recognition, the logo should not be reproduced smaller than the minimum sizes specified below.

*   **Badge Logo:**
    *   **Digital:** 300 pixels wide
    *   **Print:** 3.75 inches (95mm) wide
*   **Wordmark Logo:**
    *   **Digital:** 100 pixels wide
    *   **Print:** 1.25 inches (32mm) wide
*   **Wordmark + Grass Logo:**
    *   **Digital:** 150 pixels wide
    *   **Print:** 1.9 inches (49mm) wide
*   **Emblem Logo:**
    *   **Digital:** 200 pixels wide
    *   **Print:** 2.5 inches (65mm) wide

Always test for legibility at small sizes, especially for complex applications or lower-resolution media.

#### Logo Do's and Don'ts

To maintain brand integrity and consistency, follow these guidelines:

**Do:**
*   **Do** use the official, approved logo files provided in the Brand Asset Library.
*   **Do** maintain the specified clear space around the logo.
*   **Do** ensure sufficient contrast between the logo and its background.
*   **Do** use the appropriate logo variation for the intended application (e.g., Badge for primary use, Wordmark for simplicity).
*   **Do** scale the logo proportionally.
*   **Do** adhere to the specified color variations.

**Don't:**
*   **Don't** stretch, condense, distort, or alter the logo's proportions in any way.
*   **Don't** change the logo's colors outside the approved variations.
*   **Don't** add outlines, shadows, gradients, or other visual effects not part of the original design (except the inherent distress texture where applicable).
*   **Don't** place the logo on busy or cluttered backgrounds that compromise legibility.
*   **Don't** rotate or tilt the logo.
*   **Don't** crop parts of the logo (except when using the Emblem or Wordmark variations as intended).
*   **Don't** use old or outdated versions of the logo.
*   **Don't** place other elements within the logo's clear space.

![Placeholder for Do's and Don'ts Visual Examples] *(Suggestion: Add visual examples illustrating correct usage and common mistakes)*

### 3.2. Logo Variations

In addition to the primary Badge logo detailed above, the following variations are available for specific applications:

*   **Badge Logo (Primary):** The main logo featuring the truncated-hexagon badge, GRUNTWORKS wordmark, grass element, and soil mound. This is the preferred version for most applications.
*   **Wordmark Logo:** Consists solely of the GRUNTWORKS stencil-style logotype. Suitable for contexts where simplicity is required and the brand is already established.
*   **Wordmark + Grass Logo:** Features the GRUNTWORKS wordmark with the stylized grass element positioned above it. Used when vertical space is limited but the growth motif is desired.
*   **Emblem Logo:** Consists of the GRUNTWORKS wordmark enclosed within a rounded rectangle border. The rectangle fill is transparent, and the stroke matches the color of the wordmark. Offers a contained alternative to the wordmark alone.

#### Logo Color Usage

Specific color variations are permitted depending on the logo type:

*   **Badge Logo & Wordmark + Grass Logo:** These variations primarily use the Charcoal Black (`#2B2B25`) or Cream White (`#F2EEDB`) base colors defined in the primary palette. The internal elements (wordmark, grass, soil, tagline) maintain their standard colors relative to the base.
*   **Wordmark Logo & Emblem Logo:** These simpler variations offer more flexibility and can be rendered in the following single colors:
    *   Charcoal Black (`#2B2B25`)
    *   Cream White (`#F2EEDB`)
    *   Olive Green (`#7B8448`)
    *   Earth Brown (`#5F4528`)
    *   Safety Orange (`#F97924`)
    *   Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) - *Note: Use primarily on dark backgrounds where Cream White lacks sufficient contrast.*

Always ensure sufficient contrast between the logo and its background for maximum legibility. Refer to the main Color Palette section for standard background color usage.

### 3.5. Imagery

#### 3.5.1. Photography Philosophy

The Gruntworks photography approach embodies authentic craft and natural character, deliberately avoiding overly polished corporate aesthetics. Our imagery celebrates the honest beauty of landscaping work—capturing texture, effort, and transformation with the same distressed, natural character that defines our logo. Every photograph should feel grounded in reality, showcasing both the process and results of quality landscaping with an appreciation for natural imperfection and earned character.

#### 3.5.2. Core Photography Styles

##### Field Documentation Style

Capture authentic work-in-progress moments that show real landscaping craft in action. Focus on the intersection of skilled human effort and natural elements—hands working soil, equipment shaping land, materials being transformed. These images should feel immediate and documentary in nature, never staged or artificially perfect.

* Composition: Tight framing on work details; genuine action; natural perspectives
* Subjects: Crews actively working; material transformation; skill demonstration
* Technical: Slightly underexposed to emphasize texture; natural lighting; minimal staging

##### Landscape Transformation Style

Document the progression of landscapes from raw potential to cultivated completion. Include before, during, and after sequences that showcase both the process and results. Emphasize texture and detail over artificially vibrant colors or idealized perfection.

* Composition: Consistent framing across sequence stages; identifiable reference points
* Subjects: Property transformations; installation progressions; seasonal developments
* Technical: Consistent perspective across sequence; weathered vignetting; textural focus

##### Material Studies Style

Create detailed, textural close-ups of landscape materials that highlight natural character and quality. These images serve as both informational and atmospheric assets, celebrating the raw beauty of the elements that make up quality landscaping work.

* Composition: Macro perspective; textural emphasis; contextual placement
* Subjects: Soil varieties; stone textures; plant details; mulch; hardscape materials
* Technical: Enhanced contrast to emphasize texture; slight desaturation; natural lighting

##### Team Expertise Style

Document real teams demonstrating genuine expertise, never using artificially posed corporate imagery. Show the Pragmatic Empire Builder and Hands-On Field General in authentic working contexts, capturing moments of decision-making, problem-solving, and craft mastery.

* Composition: Environmental portraits in real settings; action-oriented; respectful framing
* Subjects: Owners reviewing plans; managers directing teams; knowledge sharing moments
* Technical: Environmental lighting; minimal intervention; authentic expressions and postures

#### 3.5.3. Technical Treatment Guidelines

##### Color Grading Specifications

All imagery should receive consistent color treatment that enhances natural texture while avoiding artificially vibrant or "digital" aesthetics.

* Saturation: Reduce by 15-20% from standard levels
* Contrast: Increase by 10-15% to emphasize texture
* Temperature: Slightly warm (add 5-10 points toward amber) to enhance natural materials
* Shadows: Slightly deepened to emphasize dimension without becoming moody
* Highlights: Slightly reduced to prevent "glossy" appearance

##### Texture Overlay Techniques

Apply subtle distressing techniques to echo the logo's worn aesthetic and unify the visual language.

* Grain: Add subtle film grain (10-15% opacity) to all photography
* Edge Treatment: Consider subtle vignetting (5-10% darkness increase at edges)
* Optional Badge Overlay: For key images, consider badge-shaped masking or framing
* Overlay Application: Always apply as a separate layer at 10-15% opacity to maintain image integrity

##### Framing Guidelines

Frame images to emphasize authenticity while maintaining a structured, intentional approach.

* Rule of Thirds: Use for most composition, but allow deliberate breaks for authenticity
* Horizon Placement: Typically lower third for landscapes to emphasize soil/ground
* Badge-Inspired Framing: Consider truncated hexagon cropping for featured images
* Margins: Leave natural space around primary subjects; avoid tight or artificial cropping

#### 3.5.4. Illustration System

##### Field Guide Illustrations

Create illustrations with the character of traditional field guides or workshop manuals—technically accurate but with visible hand-crafted quality.

* Style: Precision linework with deliberate textural imperfections
* Technique: Hand-drawn appearance (even if created digitally)
* Subject Focus: Plant species, installation details, technical specifications
* Application: Educational content, species identification, technical guides

##### Process Diagrams

Develop systematic illustrations that explain processes while maintaining a workshop-drawn aesthetic rather than slick digital perfection.

* Style: Sequential, clear workflow illustrations with hand-drawn character
* Technique: Stencil-inspired line work with intentional roughness at edges
* Subject Focus: Installation sequences, maintenance procedures, growth cycles
* Application: How-to guides, educational materials, process explanations

##### Technical Drawings

Create precise technical illustrations that maintain the authenticity of job-site drawings or field sketches.

* Style: Blueprint-inspired with visible texture and hand-drawn elements
* Technique: Combine precise measurements with textural overlays
* Subject Focus: Hardscape specifications, drainage systems, structural elements
* Application: Project plans, specification documents, educational content

##### Illustration Specifications

* Line Weights: Variable between 1-3pt to create organic feel (avoid perfectly uniform lines)
* Textures: Include subtle paper texture background and slight ink bleed effects
* Color Application: Primarily monochromatic (Charcoal Black or Olive Green) with occasional Earth Brown or Safety Orange as accent
* Digital Technique: Create base illustration then apply texture overlays at 15-20% opacity

#### 3.5.5. Iconography Framework

Each icon should be available in two treatments:
* Outline Version: Stencil-style outline with 2px weight and distressed edges
* Filled Version: Solid fill with subtly distressed edges and minimal interior detail

##### Stencil Treatment Specification

All icons should receive consistent treatment to echo the wordmark's stencil aesthetic.

* Edge Quality: Slightly rough, irregular edges (not perfectly smooth)
* Interior Texture: Subtle 10% noise/grain within filled areas
* Corner Treatment: Slightly rounded corners (1px radius) with irregular execution
* Cutout Effect: Optional internal cutouts that mimic stencil bridges

##### Badge Container System

Develop badge-shaped containers based on the logo to house and organize icons.

* Primary Badge: Full hexagonal badge shape echoing the logo
* Simplified Badge: Rounded rectangle variant for smaller applications
* Micro Badge: Minimal corner-cut shape for smallest applications
* Application: Use consistently for grouping related icons or creating navigational elements

##### Sizing and Spacing Guidelines

* Standard Sizes: 16px, 24px, 32px, 64px, 128px
* Minimum Size: Never use below 16px to maintain distressed character
* Touch Target: For interactive icons, maintain minimum 44px x 44px touch area

* **Emphasize Control:** Highlight that the landscaper maintains complete control and decision-making authority, with technology serving their vision and long-term goals.
* **Focus on Legacy Building:** Stress how automation handles mundane tasks, freeing up their time to focus on building their company's future and lasting impact.

2.  **You Need More Than Vendors, You Need Partners:** Position Gruntworks as a dedicated growth partner who understands both soil and software, respecting their expertise while providing systems for scale. We're in the trenches with you, not just selling you software.

We seed your search, engineer your site, irrigate your ops—you harvest the profits and build your legacy.
