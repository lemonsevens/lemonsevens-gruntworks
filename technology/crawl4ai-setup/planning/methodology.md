# Selected Project Methodology

## Methodology
- **Name:** Kanban
- **Specifics/Framework:** Utilize Airtable (Base ID: `app9cv9ob4Qt0A8C0`) for visualizing workflow. Standard Kanban practices will be applied: Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP), Manage Flow, and Make Policies Explicit.

## Rationale
- Chosen based on project characteristics:
    - Flexibility: Medium (Core tools stable, implementation details may evolve)
    - Team Structure: Small/Medium Internal Team
    - Delivery Cadence: Incremental (Allows early feedback)
    - Client Involvement: Medium (Regular feedback from internal team)
- Aligns with project goals by enabling continuous flow, high visibility for the internal team, and flexibility to adapt as the setup progresses.

## Key Practices Overview
- **Visualize Workflow:** Use an Airtable board (within Base `app9cv9ob4Qt0A8C0`, likely in the `Tasks` table linked to this project) with columns representing workflow stages (e.g., Inbox, Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked, Waiting). Define which statuses map to the primary Kanban columns (e.g., ToDo = Inbox/Not Started, Doing = In Progress, Done = Completed).
- **Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Define and respect WIP limits for the 'In Progress' stage to prevent bottlenecks and maintain focus.
- **Manage Flow:** Regularly review the board to identify bottlenecks (e.g., tasks stuck in 'Blocked' or 'Waiting') and improve the process.
- **Make Policies Explicit:** Define criteria for when a task is considered 'Ready' to be pulled into 'Not Started' or 'In Progress', and when it is 'Completed'.
