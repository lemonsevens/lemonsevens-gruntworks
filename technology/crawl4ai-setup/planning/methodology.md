# Selected Project Methodology

## Methodology
- **Name:** Kanban
- **Specifics/Framework:** Utilize Airtable (Base ID: `app9cv9ob4Qt0A8C0`) for visualizing workflow. Standard Kanban practices will be applied: Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP), Manage Flow, and Make Policies Explicit.

## Rationale
- Chosen based on project characteristics:
    - Flexibility: Medium (Core tools stable, implementation details may evolve)
    - Team Structure: Small/Medium Internal Team
    - Delivery Cadence: Incremental (Allows early feedback)
    - Client Involvement: Medium (Regular feedback from internal team)
- Aligns with project goals by enabling continuous flow, high visibility for the internal team, and flexibility to adapt as the setup progresses.

## Key Practices Overview
- **Visualize Workflow:** Use an Airtable board (within Base `app9cv9ob4Qt0A8C0`, likely in the `Tasks` table linked to this project) with columns representing workflow stages (e.g., ToDo, Doing, Done).
- **Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Define and respect WIP limits for 'Doing' stages to prevent bottlenecks and maintain focus.
- **Manage Flow:** Regularly review the board to identify bottlenecks and improve the process.
- **Make Policies Explicit:** Define criteria for when a task is considered 'Ready' to be pulled into 'Doing' and when it is 'Done'.
