# Placeholder Dockerfile for crawl4ai service

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install crawl4ai and any other dependencies
# Consider using a requirements.txt file for better dependency management
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir crawl4ai==0.5.0

# Example: Install PostgreSQL client if needed for direct DB export from the script
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the local code directory contents into the container at /app
# COPY . /app

# Define environment variables if needed (can also be passed via docker-compose)
# ENV MY_VARIABLE=my_value

# Command to run the application (replace with your actual script)
# CMD ["python", "your_crawler_script.py"]
