## 5. Personalized Demo Template Workflow

A key component of our sales process is the personalized demo, designed to provide tailored insights and solutions to potential clients based on their specific needs and online presence.

The automated demo workflow is triggered by website needs assessment submissions or CRM status changes. It collects data from various sources, uses AI for content generation, and delivers a customized presentation. There are different paths depending on whether needs assessment data is available.
