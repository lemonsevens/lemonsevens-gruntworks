## Our Core Philosophy: The 2S-3S Framework

The Gruntworks Operating System is built around the "Sell & Ship" (2S) operational philosophy, supported by the "Strategy, Systems, Support" (3S) pillars. Every significant activity maps to either Sell (generating revenue) or Ship (delivering value). Strategy, Systems, and Support exist to enhance Sell and Ship.

**Primary Modes (The "2S")**

1.  **Sell**: Generating revenue, including marketing, sales, and customer acquisition.
2.  **Ship**: Fulfillment and delivery of value to clients.

**Supporting Pillars (The "3S")**

1.  **Strategy**: Defining vision, goals, and direction.
2.  **Systems**: Tools, technology, automation, and processes.
3.  **Support**: Resolving issues for internal team and clients.
