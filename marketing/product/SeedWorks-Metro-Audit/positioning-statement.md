# Pre-Offer Positioning Session Notes for SeedWorks Metro Audit

## 1. Persona & Pain Point

**Persona:** “The Empowered Landscaper” – Owners and key operational leaders of established, mid-sized regional landscaping businesses (\$500K–\$5M revenue) who have an online presence but rank below the top three in their service areas. They value practical experience, tangible results, and genuine partnership.

**Pain Point:** Labor shortages threaten their capacity to deliver, compounded by technology hesitation—they fear digital solutions will complicate rather than enhance, and worry about cost, complexity, and impersonality.

## 2. Competitive Alternatives

1. **DIY & “My Nephew” Tinkering**
   Owners or relatives fiddle with SaaS tools and GBP settings for inconsistent results.
2. **Generic Agency Outsourcing**
   Broad, high-cost SEO/marketing packages that miss service-area nuances and require heavy relationship management.
3. **Inaction & Sporadic Guerilla**
   Rely on word-of-mouth and occasional flyers or social posts—no systematic approach.
