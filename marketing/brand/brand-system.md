## 3. BRAND IDENTITY

### Logo

#### Visual Overview
Imagine a sturdy, truncated-hexagon shield—like the badge on a work boot—rendered in a charcoal-black field. Centered across that field, the word GRUNTWORKS appears in heavy, stencil-style uppercase, its off-white letters carrying a subtle, grainy distress that reads as "industrial grit." Above the name, a row of stylized grass blades arcs gently, and below it a textured mound of earth sits as a visual foundation.

#### Logo Composition
*   **Shield Base:** Truncated-hexagon with softly rounded corners. Conveys protection, authority and an industrial badge aesthetic.
*   **Logotype: "GRUNTWORKS":** Bold, stencil-style uppercase. Off-white fill with a light distress texture for an authentic, "worked-in" feel.
*   **Grass Silhouette (Top):** A row of simplified blades forming a gentle arch. Symbolizes the brand's focus on growth and green-industry expertise.
*   **Soil Mound (Bottom):** Rough, uneven texture suggesting freshly turned earth. Grounds the design literally and metaphorically.

#### Texture & Finish Notes
*   **Distressed Overlay:** Fine speckle across all elements to mimic wear, paint chips and dirt.
*   **Bevel & Emboss:** Subtle edge embossing on the shield to add dimensionality, like a metal plate.
*   **Contrast:** High-contrast typography (Cream White on Charcoal) for instant legibility in any application.

#### Brand Takeaway
The combined effect of strong geometry, organic motifs and textured grit positions Gruntworks as a no-nonsense partner—hard-working, reliable and deeply rooted in the real world of landscaping operations.
