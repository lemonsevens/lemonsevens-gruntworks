## LOGO DESIGN PROMPT

### Logo Description (Reference)

**Visual Overview:** Imagine a sturdy, truncated-hexagon shield—like the badge on a work boot—rendered in a charcoal-black field. Centered across that field, the word GRUNTWORKS appears in heavy, stencil-style uppercase, its off-white letters carrying a subtle, grainy distress that reads as "industrial grit." Above the name, a row of stylized grass blades arcs gently, and below it a textured mound of earth sits as a visual foundation.

**Logo Composition:**
- **Shield Base:** Truncated-hexagon with softly rounded corners. Charcoal Black (`#1C1C1C`) field. Conveys protection, authority and an industrial badge aesthetic.
- **Logotype: "GRUNTWORKS":** Bold, stencil-style uppercase. Cream White (`#F2EEDB`) fill with a light distress texture for an authentic, "worked-in" feel.
- **Grass Silhouette (Top):** A row of simplified blades forming a gentle arch. Olive Green (`#7B8448`). Symbolizes growth and green-industry expertise.
- **Soil Mound (Bottom):** Rough, uneven texture suggesting freshly turned earth. Earth Brown (`#8B5A2B`). Grounds the design literally and metaphorically.

**Texture & Finish Notes:**
- **Distressed Overlay:** Fine speckle across all elements to mimic wear, paint chips and dirt.
- **Bevel & Emboss:** Subtle edge embossing on the shield to add dimensionality, like a metal plate.
- **Contrast:** High-contrast typography (Cream White on Charcoal) for instant legibility.

**Brand Takeaway:** The combined effect of strong geometry, organic motifs and textured grit positions Gruntworks as a no-nonsense partner—hard-working, reliable and deeply rooted in the real world of landscaping operations.

*(Note: Refer to the Brand Asset Library for official logo files and usage guidelines regarding clear space, minimum size, and specific Do's/Don'ts.)*

### Logo Variations

Based on the defined Gruntworks logo, ensure the following standard variations are available in the Brand Asset Library for diverse applications:

1.  **Horizontal Version**: Logo elements arranged in a horizontal format for website headers and business cards.
2.  **Stacked Version**: Compact stacked arrangement for square applications (e.g., social media profiles).
3.  **Icon Only**: Simplified shield/grass/soil element (or agreed-upon icon) for social media profiles and favicons where the full logo is too complex.
4.  **Wordmark Only**: "GRUNTWORKS" text-only version for situations where the icon isn't needed or suitable.
5.  **Reverse Version**: Cream White (`#F2EEDB`) / light version for use on Charcoal Black (`#1C1C1C`) or other dark backgrounds.
6.  **Single Color Version**: One-color (typically Cream White or Charcoal Black) version for limited color applications (e.g., embroidery, etching).

### Product Module Icons

Design a set of three distinct icons representing the core Gruntworks product modules, ensuring they align with the brand's iconography style (simple, clean, functional, consistent line weight) and visual identity:

1.  **SeedWorks (Local SEO & GBP Optimization):** Icon should visually suggest concepts like local discovery, online visibility, map targeting, lead generation, or growth from a seed/foundation. Incorporate brand themes (landscaping, growth, technology). Consider subtle industrial botanical or weathered steel motifs/textures if appropriate.

2.  **SiteWorks (Websites):** Icon should visually represent concepts like a digital foundation, website structure, online presence, lead conversion, or showcasing craft online. Align with brand themes (landscaping, technology, professionalism, results). Consider subtle industrial botanical or weathered steel motifs/textures if appropriate.

3.  **FlowWorks (Automation & CRM Implementation):** Icon should visually convey concepts like operational efficiency, streamlined workflows, automation, time savings, or system integration. Connect to brand themes (technology, efficiency, control, irrigation/flow). Consider subtle industrial botanical or weathered steel motifs/textures if appropriate.

- Icons should be visually cohesive as a set.
