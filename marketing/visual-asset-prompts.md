## LOGO DESIGN PROMPT

### Logo Description (Reference)

**Visual Overview:** Imagine a sturdy, truncated-hexagon shield—like the badge on a work boot—rendered in a charcoal-black field. In each corner are small circular cutouts that resemble rivet holes. Centered across that field, the word GRUNTWORKS appears in heavy, stencil-style uppercase, its off-white letters carrying a subtle, grainy distress that reads as "industrial grit." Above the name, a row of stylized grass blades arcs gently, and below it a textured mound of earth sits as a visual foundation, with the tagline "Growing Landscaping Companies" appearing in safety orange.

**Logo Composition:**
- **Shield Base:** Truncated-hexagon with softly rounded corners and rivet holes in corners. Charcoal Black (`#2B2B25`) field. Conveys protection, authority and an industrial badge aesthetic.
- **Logotype: "GRUNTWORKS":** Bold, stencil-style uppercase. Cream White (`#F2EEDB`) fill with a light distress texture for an authentic, "worked-in" feel.
- **Grass Silhouette (Top):** A row of simplified blades forming a gentle arch. Olive Green (`#7B8448`) or alternatively Shaded Green (`#646C36`). Symbolizes growth and green-industry expertise.
- **Soil Mound (Bottom):** Rough, uneven texture suggesting freshly turned earth. Earth Brown (`#5F4528`). Grounds the design literally and metaphorically.
- **Tagline:** "Growing Landscaping Companies" in Safety Orange (`#F97924`), placed within the soil mound, using Mohave font, bold.

**Texture & Finish Notes:**
- **Distressed Overlay:** Fine speckle across all elements to mimic wear, paint chips and dirt. This distressed overlay texture is applied *only* to the primary Badge Logo and the Wordmark + Grass Logo variations. The Wordmark Logo and Emblem Logo variations do not use this texture.
- **Bevel & Emboss:** Subtle edge embossing on the shield to add dimensionality, like a metal plate.
- **Contrast:** High-contrast typography (Cream White on Charcoal) for instant legibility.

**Brand Takeaway:** The combined effect of strong geometry, organic motifs and textured grit positions Gruntworks as a no-nonsense partner—hard-working, reliable and deeply rooted in the real world of landscaping operations.

**Clear Space:** To ensure the logo's visibility and impact, always maintain a minimum clear space around it. This exclusion zone should be free of text, graphics, or other elements that might clutter or compete with the logo.
- **Badge Logo & Emblem Logo:** The minimum clear space is defined by half the height of the primary "GRUNTWORKS" logotype within the badge or emblem.
- **Wordmark Logo & Wordmark + Grass Logo:** The minimum clear space is defined by the height of the letter "G" in "GRUNTWORKS".

**Minimum Size:** To ensure legibility and brand recognition, the logo should not be reproduced smaller than the minimum sizes specified below.
- **Badge Logo:** Digital: 300 pixels wide; Print: 3.75 inches (95mm) wide
- **Wordmark Logo:** Digital: 100 pixels wide; Print: 1.25 inches (32mm) wide
- **Wordmark + Grass Logo:** Digital: 150 pixels wide; Print: 1.9 inches (49mm) wide
- **Emblem Logo:** Digital: 200 pixels wide; Print: 2.5 inches (65mm) wide
- **Icon Only Logo:** Digital: 100 pixels wide; Print: 1 inch (25mm) wide

*(Note: Refer to the Brand Asset Library for official logo files and usage guidelines regarding clear space, minimum size, and specific Do's/Don'ts.)*

### Logo Variations

Based on the defined Gruntworks logo, ensure the following standard variations are available in the Brand Asset Library for diverse applications:

1.  **Badge Logo (Primary):** The main logo featuring the truncated-hexagon badge with rivet holes, GRUNTWORKS wordmark, grass element, soil mound, and tagline. This is the preferred version for most applications.

2.  **Wordmark Logo:** Consists solely of the GRUNTWORKS stencil-style logotype without distressing. Suitable for contexts where simplicity is required and the brand is already established.

3.  **Wordmark + Grass Logo:** Features the GRUNTWORKS wordmark with the stylized grass element positioned above it. Uses the distressed texture like the primary Badge Logo. Used when vertical space is limited but the growth motif is desired.

4.  **Emblem Logo:** Consists of the GRUNTWORKS wordmark enclosed within a rounded rectangle border. The rectangle fill is transparent, and the stroke matches the color of the wordmark. Does not use the distressed texture. Offers a contained alternative to the wordmark alone.

5.  **Icon Only Logo:** NEW VARIATION - A simplified emblem derived from the primary Badge Logo, featuring only the shield/badge shape with the grass and soil elements, without the GRUNTWORKS wordmark or tagline. To be used for social media profiles, favicons, and other applications where the full logo would be too complex or small.

6.  **Reverse Version:** Light version (primarily Cream White `#F2EEDB`) for use on Charcoal Black (`#2B2B25`) or other dark backgrounds. Available for Badge, Wordmark, Wordmark + Grass, Emblem, and Icon Only variations.

7.  **Single Color Version:** One-color versions (typically Cream White, Charcoal Black, Olive Green, Earth Brown, or Safety Orange) for limited color applications (e.g., embroidery, etching). Available for Wordmark, Emblem, and Icon Only variations.

### Product Module Icons

Design a set of three distinct icons representing the core Gruntworks product modules, using the brand's iconography framework with stencil-inspired treatment and distressed aesthetic. These icons should:

1.  **SeedWorks (Local SEO & GBP Optimization):** Icon should visually suggest concepts like local discovery, online visibility, map targeting, lead generation, or growth from a seed/foundation. Incorporate brand themes (landscaping, growth, technology). Apply the stencil treatment with slightly rough, irregular edges and subtle interior texture.

2.  **SiteWorks (Websites):** Icon should visually represent concepts like a digital foundation, website structure, online presence, lead conversion, or showcasing craft online. Align with brand themes (landscaping, technology, professionalism, results). Apply the stencil treatment with slightly rough, irregular edges and subtle interior texture.

3.  **FlowWorks (Automation & CRM Implementation):** Icon should visually convey concepts like operational efficiency, streamlined workflows, automation, time savings, or system integration. Connect to brand themes (technology, efficiency, control, irrigation/flow). Apply the stencil treatment with slightly rough, irregular edges and subtle interior texture.

#### Icon Specifications:
- Icons should be visually cohesive as a set and reflect the workshop-drawn, field guide aesthetic
- Available in both outline version (stencil-style outline with 2px weight and distressed edges) and filled version (solid fill with distressed edges)
- Use the primary brand color palette (Charcoal Black, Cream White, Olive Green, Earth Brown) with potential accents (Safety Orange, Steel Blue, Shaded Green)
- Apply a subtle 10% noise/grain within filled areas
- Use slightly rounded corners (1px radius) with irregular execution
- Include optional internal cutouts that mimic stencil bridges
- Ensure icons are scalable and legible at standard sizes (16px, 24px, 32px, 64px, 128px) with minimum size of 16px
- Design icons to work within the Badge Container System when appropriate:
  - Primary Badge: Full hexagonal badge shape echoing the logo
  - Simplified Badge: Rounded rectangle variant for smaller applications
  - Micro Badge: Minimal corner-cut shape for smallest applications
