# 2S-3S Operating System Guide

> **Audience:** Anyone seeking to understand the foundational principles and high-level framework of the Gruntworks operational model.
> **Goal:** To outline the "Sell & Ship" (2S) operational philosophy, its supporting "Strategy, Systems, Support" (3S) pillars, and the fundamental operational rhythm. This document serves as a conceptual guide. For detailed system configurations, specific tool setups, comprehensive procedures, and day-to-day operational mechanics, please refer to the `OPS-Systems-Overview.md` document.

## 1. Core Philosophy: The 2S-3S Framework

The Gruntworks Operating System is built around a simple yet powerful framework designed to ensure focus on value delivery and sustainable growth. It consists of two primary operational modes and three essential supporting pillars.

*   **Primary Modes (The "2S")**

    1.  **Sell**: This mode encompasses all activities directly related to generating revenue. It includes marketing efforts, sales processes, customer acquisition, and building the pipeline. The core objective of "Sell" mode is to drive growth and ensure the financial health of the business.
    2.  **Ship**: This mode is focused on all aspects of fulfillment and delivery of value to clients. It includes project execution, service delivery, product development (if applicable), and ensuring that commitments made during the "Sell" phase are met with quality and efficiency.

*   **Supporting Pillars (The "3S")**

    The Primary Modes are enabled and accelerated by three crucial supporting pillars:

    1.  **Strategy**: This pillar involves defining the overarching vision, setting long-term goals (like Objectives and Key Results - OKRs), making key decisions about market positioning, and ensuring the entire team is aligned with the company's strategic direction. It answers "Where are we going and why?"
    2.  **Systems**: This pillar represents the backbone of operations. It includes the tools, technologies, automations, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and repeatable processes that enable efficient and scalable execution of both "Sell" and "Ship" activities. It focuses on "How do we operate effectively?"
    3.  **Support**: This pillar is dedicated to maintaining operational health and resolving issues. This includes client support (addressing queries, solving problems) and internal team support (ensuring team members have what they need, resolving internal roadblocks). It ensures "How do we keep things running smoothly?"

**Interrelation:**

Every significant activity, task, or metric within the Gruntworks operational model should clearly map to one of the Primary S modes (Sell or Ship). The Strategy, Systems, and Support pillars are not ends in themselves; they exist solely to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the Sell and Ship modes. They provide the foundation and lubrication for the core value-driving engine of the business.

## 5. End-to-End Workflow: Conceptual Overview

The 2S-3S framework operates on a rhythm of cadences designed to ensure continuous alignment, execution, and improvement. The fundamental flow is:

1.  **Plan (Strategy Focus)**:
    *   Activities: Annual and quarterly planning, objective setting (OKRs), strategic alignment across the team.
    *   Outcome: Clear goals, defined priorities (Rocks), and a shared understanding of the strategic direction.

2.  **Execute (Sell/Ship Focus)**:
    *   Activities: Daily and weekly execution of tasks related to Sell (revenue generation) and Ship (value delivery) modes.
    *   Outcome: Progress on Rocks, delivery of products/services, and achievement of Key Results.

3.  **Review & Iterate (Continuous Improvement Focus)**:
    *   Activities: Weekly reviews (e.g., L10 meetings), performance monitoring (Scorecards), issue identification, and process refinement.
    *   Outcome: Identification of what's working and what's not, generation of corrective actions (new Issues or Tasks), and adaptation of plans and processes.

**High-Level Cadence Rhythm:**

| Cadence        | Primary Focus & Purpose                           | Key Outputs/Activities                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Annual**     | Long-term vision, strategic objectives            | Annual Goals, High-Level OKRs, Vision Docs  |
| **Quarterly**  | Mid-term priorities, Rock definition & alignment  | Quarterly Rocks, KR Review/Reset            |
| **Weekly L10** | Tactical review, progress tracking, issue solving | Scorecard Review, Rock/Task Updates, Issues |
| **Daily**      | Focused execution, task completion                | Daily Priorities Met, Status Updates        |
| **Ongoing**    | System health, process adherence, learning        | SOP Usage/Updates, System Hygiene Tasks     |

This cyclical process ensures that strategic plans are translated into actionable tasks, progress is consistently monitored, and the overall system is continuously refined.

## 7. Appendix: Core Terminology Reference

This appendix defines key terms used within the 2S-3S operational philosophy.

### Core Concepts

* **2S-3S**: The operating system framework combining two primary modes (Sell, Ship) and three supporting pillars (Strategy, Systems, Support).

* **Primary Modes**:
  * **Sell**: All revenue-generating activities including marketing, sales, and customer acquisition.
  * **Ship**: All fulfillment, delivery, and production activities.

* **Supporting Pillars**:
  * **Strategy**: Planning, OKRs, roadmapping, and alignment activities.
  * **Systems**: Technical infrastructure, automation, and process design.
  * **Support**: Issue resolution for both internal team and external clients.

### Tools & Platforms

* **Fibery**: Workflow management platform used to implement the 2S-3S system.
* **MKDocs**: Documentation system used for creating the operations manual.
* **Figma**: Design and diagramming tool used for visualizing processes and systems.

### Methodology Terms

* **OKRs**: Objectives and Key Results - goal-setting framework.
* **Rocks**: Quarterly priorities derived from Key Results (term from EOS/Traction methodology).
* **L10**: Level 10 Meeting - a structured weekly leadership meeting format (from EOS/Traction).
* **Scorecard**: Weekly metrics dashboard showing performance indicators with red/yellow/green status.
* **Spaces/Apps**: Organizational units within Fibery that contain related entities and workflows.
