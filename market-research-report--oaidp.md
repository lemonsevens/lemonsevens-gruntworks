ents increasingly expect digital convenience (online booking, electronic payments) and sustainable practices (native plants, water-efficient designs). Technology presents a key opportunity: field management software, automation (like robotic mowers), and data-driven tools can streamline operations and boost profitability. However, adoption has been slow among many small firms due to cost and generational barriers. Strategic implications: To increase revenue and margins, landscaping companies should focus on upselling comprehensive maintenance plans, improving workforce productivity, and embracing efficient technologies. For new software or service providers entering this space, solutions that address scheduling inefficiencies, customer communication, and cost control (especially labor and fuel) will fill critical pain points. In the next 3–5 years, the industry is expected to continue on a moderate growth trajectory (~3–5% CAGR) barring a major economic downturn, with optimism tempered by labor and regulatory risks. Companies that modernize their operations and cater to evolving customer preferences – such as eco-friendly landscaping and on-demand services – are poised to outperform. The following report provides a detailed analysis of the industry’s structure, customer segments, operations, and recommendations for leveraging these insights into actionable business strategies.

## 2. Industry Overview

**Market Size & Growth:**  
The U.S. landscaping services industry generates over $150 billion in annual revenue as of 2024. Industry revenue reached an estimated $153–158 billion in 2024, up from roughly $130 billion in 2019 (a ~4% compound annual growth rate). This steady growth persisted through the pandemic years, as residential demand for lawn and garden improvements surged with more people at home. According to IBISWorld data, the market expanded about 4–5% yearly recently and is projected to maintain a mid-single-digit growth rate in the near term. Short-term forecasts (~5 years) anticipate continued expansion driven by strong housing and renovation trends, though growth may moderate if interest rates and inflation temper consumer spending. For example, one forecast sees the market reaching ~$190 billion by 2025 and ~$230 billion by 2030 (approx. 3.9% CAGR) under stable economic conditions. Overall, industry growth is expected to stay in the 3–5% range annually through 2028, barring a significant recession.

**Macroeconomic Drivers:**  
Several broad factors influence landscaping demand. Residential real estate activity is paramount – home sales, housing starts, and property values correlate with landscaping spending (new homeowners often invest in landscaping, and higher home equity enables improvement projects). The pandemic home-improvement boom saw many households upgrade outdoor spaces, a trend that continues as outdoor living remains popular. Disposable income and consumer confidence drive discretionary landscaping projects (e.g. new patios, outdoor kitchens), while basic maintenance is somewhat resilient even in slower economies. On the commercial side, business investment and construction (office parks, retail centers, apartments) create demand for installation and maintenance of landscapes for curb appeal and tenant satisfaction. Government and institutional spending (parks, schools, road medians) also contribute, influenced by municipal budgets and policies.

**Regulatory and Environmental Drivers:**  
Environmental regulations and local ordinances increasingly affect landscaping practices. For i​

ns in drought-prone states** (like California’s limits on irrigation) are driving adoption of drought-tolerant landscaping (xeriscaping) and efficient irrigation systems. Some municipalities have passed noise and emissions regulations, including bans on gas-powered leaf blowers and mowers in certain cities, forcing companies to invest in electric equipment. California’s state regulation mandating zero-emission small off-road engines by 2024 is a prime example of an equipment rule impacting landscapers statewide. Pesticide and fertilizer regulations also shape services (e.g. limits on chemical usage encourage organic lawn care alternatives).

**On the Labor Front:**  
Immigration and work visa policies are crucial – the H-2B guest worker program, which many landscape firms rely on for seasonal labor, has annual caps that constrain workforce supply. Changes to minimum wage laws and overtime rules similarly affect operating costs in this labor-intensive industry.

**Recent Performance:**  
The industry proved relatively resilient through recent economic swings. In 2020, maintenance services were deemed essential in many areas, allowing companies to operate (with precautions) and keep revenue fairly stable. By 2021–2022, pent-up demand and a hot housing market led to a strong rebound in landscape construction and installation work; industry surveys showed double-digit revenue growth for many firms in 2021.  
**Figure:** Combined 2022 revenue of top 150 landscaping firms was $16.2 billion (up 16% from 2021), and an average 10% growth was projected for 2023 among these firms. However, inflation in 2022–2023 (fuel, plants, fertilizer costs) squeezed profit margins even as revenue grew. Companies responded with price increases – landscaping service prices rose ~5–10% in many markets to offset higher costs. Entering 2024, the industry saw stable demand but continued challenges with cost inflation and labor shortages. Notably, 90+% of industry business owners express confidence in market growth despite near-term headwinds. This cautious optimism reflects underlying demand for outdoor services even in uncertain economic times.

**Industry Employment:**  
Landscaping is a significant U.S. employer, with around 1.3 to 1.4 million people working as landscapers, groundskeepers, gardeners, and support staff. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports ~1.30 million landscaping and groundskeeping jobs in 2023, and projects about 5% growth in employment from 2023 to 2033 – roughly 65,000 additional jobs – in line with average occupational growth. Industry employment grew faster than overall job growth in the past decade (~10% from 2019 to 2029 per BLS) driven by service demand and an aging population outsourcing yard work. However, labor supply remains tight (discussed in Section 6). The workforce is largely hourly wage earners with a national average wage around $39,800 per year (about $19/hour) for non-supervisory landscaping workers. Many positions are seasonal; in northern states, winter layoffs are common (except for snow removal crews). The industry also relies on a migrant and seasonal workforce, including thousands of H-2B visa workers each year. Availability of willing labor – influenced by immigration policy and competition from other industries like construction – is a pivotal factor for landscaping companies.

**Summary:**  
The U.S. landscaping industry is large, growing, and economically important, with stable base demand for maintenance and substantial opportunities in installation projects. Macroeconomic trends (housing, consumer spending) and regulations (labor and environmental) will continue to shape industry growth. Over the next five years, moderate growth is expected, underpinned by Americans’ sustained investment in their outdoor environments, yet tempered by persistent structural challenges in labor and cost management.

## 3. Market Segmentation
The landscaping industry serves a diverse range of services and customer types. We can segment the market in several dimensions:

### A. By Service Type:
**Landscape Maintenance & Lawn Care:**  
Regular upkeep of lawns and gardens (mowing, trimming, edging), lawn fertilization and weed control, pruning, bed maintenance, and seasonal clean-ups. This is the bread-and-butter segment, with the vast majority of companies (over 80%) offering basic maintenance services like mowing and trimming. Maintenance work provides recurring revenue – e.g. weekly mowing contracts or seasonal yard clean-ups – making it a stable core business for many firms. Lawn care (application of fertilizers, herbicides, pest control) is often offered by specialists as well as full-service landscapers; about 86% of landscape professionals offer lawn treatment services in addition to mowing.

**Landscape Design and Construction (Design/Build):**  
This involves designing outdoor spaces and installing plantings and hardscape features (patios, walkways, retaining walls, decks, water features). About 70–71% of landscaping companies provide design and installation services. Design/build projects are typically higher-value, one-time jobs – such as a homeowner hiring a contractor to design and install a new garden, or a commercial client building new landscaping for a facility. This segment’s revenue can be significant (often 30–40% of a full-service firm’s revenue) but is more cyclical, tied to economic conditions and client capital spending.

**Horticultural Specialty Services (Trees & Ornamental Plants):**  
Services focusing on trees, shrubs, and specialty garden plants, including tree pruning/removal, arborist services, and plant health care. Approximately 66% of landscapers offer tree and ornamental plant services, though often this is basic tree trimming as part of maintenance. There are also dedicated tree care companies (like Bartlett Tree Experts, Davey Tree) that dominate this niche.

**Irrigation and Water Management:**  
Installation and maintenance of irrigation systems (sprinklers, drip systems), as well as water features like fountains and ponds. Just over 50% of companies offer irrigation services – some firms specialize solely in irrigation, while many full-service landscapers have an irrigation division. Efficient irrigation is a growing need in many regions due to water regulations, making this a growth sub-segment.

**Snow & Ice Management:**  
In colder climates, many landscaping companies offer snow plowing, shoveling, and de-icing services in winter months to complement their lawn maintenance off-season. Nearly 46% of landscaping companies (especially in northern states) offer snow and ice removal services. While not “landscaping” per se, it is a critical seasonal service for client retention and year-round employee utilization. Some larger firms even have separate snow divisions.

**Ancillary Services:**  
Many landscapers diversify with additional offerings. Popular add-ons include seasonal color plantings (annual flower beds), offered by ~55% of firms; landscape lighting installation; vegetation management for utilities or rights-of-way (22% offer these); pest and mosquito control (22%); and holiday lighting/decor (20%). These services can boost revenue from existing clients. The trend is toward being a “one-stop outdoor service provider” – indeed, industry surveys show 90% of landscapers offer at least one additional service beyond their core offerings.

**Service Mix:**  
On average, maintenance contracts (mowing, lawn care) make up the largest share of industry revenue, thanks to their recurring nature. Installation/design projects comprise the next largest share. A survey by Lawn & Landscape found that for many companies, maintenance work yields steadier profit margins, whereas design/build can drive growth but with higher variability. Notably, hardscape installation (e.g. patios) often commands the highest customer spending among project types, followed by softscape installation (plants) and then ongoing maintenance. Companies often strive to balance a mix of maintenance (for cash flow) and installs (for growth and higher revenue per job).

### B. By Customer Type (End Market):
**Residential:**  
Single-family homeowners, multi-family residences (HOAs, apartment complexes), and estate owners. This is the largest segment by number of clients and a major share of revenue. As noted, about 59% of industry revenue comes from single-family residential properties. Homeowners typically seek lawn mowing, lawn care, gardening, and small landscape projects. Key preferences include reliability, curb appeal, and cost-effectiveness. Residential jobs tend to be smaller in value but higher volume. Within residential, there is a spectrum: some homeowners want basic, low-cost maintenance while others invest in high-end landscape designs as a status and lifestyle enhancement. The DIY alternative is a factor here – many Americans do some lawn care themselves, so residential landscapers compete not just with each other but with the homeowner’s own time and willingness. That said, an aging population and busy dual-income households are driving more outsourcing of yard work. Residential clients often find landscapers through word-of-mouth, local ads, or online platforms (Angi, Thumbtack, LawnStarter, etc.), and they increasingly expect quick estimates and the ability to communicate via phone or apps.

*Pain Points for Residential Customers:*
