# Project Vision Statement

## Purpose
To develop a creative outreach strategy for contacting key decision-makers (Owners, CEOs, COOs, Operations Managers) at mid-sized regional landscaping companies, overcoming the challenge of finding their direct contact information (email/phone), and delivering a compelling pitch for local small business marketing services.

## Target Audience or Beneficiaries
This project primarily benefits the internal sales and marketing teams by providing them with a defined strategy to effectively reach and engage prospective clients within the mid-sized regional landscaping company sector.

## Value Proposition
Overcome Outreach Barriers: This strategy delivers specific tactics to find and connect with key landscaping business leaders, circumventing common obstacles like lack of online presence or readily available contact information.

## Key Components or Deliverables
1.  Prospect Research & Contact Identification Playbook: Documented methods for identifying target companies and finding contact information (email, phone) for key decision-makers, exploring alternatives to standard online sources.
2.  Creative Outreach Tactics: A set of innovative strategies and scripts designed to capture the attention of decision-makers when direct contact information is unavailable or initial contact is made through the general business line.

## Future Vision
