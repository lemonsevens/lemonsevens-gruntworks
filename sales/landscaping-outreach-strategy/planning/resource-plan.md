## Integration/Alignment Notes
- The core Markdown document serves as the central playbook, defining the strategy and how supporting resources are used.
- Prospect data gathered via directories, scraping, lists, and manual research will be organized (likely in CRM or spreadsheets) and referenced/linked from the playbook.
- Outreach tactics (direct mail, events, content) are defined in the playbook, with execution managed via CRM/spreadsheets and supported by external services/platforms.
- Communication tools (CRM, Phone System) support the execution phase outlined in the playbook.

## Specification Rationale
- Markdown (`.md`) was chosen for its simplicity, portability, and version control friendliness.
- Specific tools listed are examples; alternatives can be substituted if they fulfill the same purpose and integrate with the overall process (managed primarily via CRM/spreadsheets and the central Markdown playbook).
