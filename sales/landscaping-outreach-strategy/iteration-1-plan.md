# Iteration 1 Plan: Define Target Profile and Initiate Prospect Data Gathering Process

This document outlines the tasks for Iteration 1 of the Landscaping Outreach Strategy project, focusing on documenting and testing the initial prospect data gathering process based on pre-existing target profile and persona research.

## Tasks

**Task LOS-S1-001-b: Document Prospect Identification & List Building Process (Phase 2)**
- **Objective:** To detail the step-by-step process for using the planned resources (directories, scraping, lists, enrichment) to find qualifying prospects (based on existing Target Profile/Personas) and populate the Airtable CRM.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Step-by-step process for using each planned data source (from `resource-plan.md`) documented.
    - Instructions on how to evaluate prospects against the existing Target Profile (found in e.g., `marketing/buyers.md`).
    - Process for entering/updating data in the Airtable CRM (configured in LOS-002-b) defined.
    - Instructions on using the 'Data Source Notes' field in Airtable to track effectiveness.
    - Relevant section in `outreach-playbook.md` (created in LOS-003-b) populated with this process documentation.
- **Dependencies:** LOS-002-b (Airtable CRM Configured), LOS-003-b (Playbook structure exists), *Existence of Target Profile/Persona documentation (e.g., `marketing/buyers.md`)*
- **Relevant Resources:** `resource-plan.md`, `architecture.md`, Airtable CRM setup, Existing Target Profile/Persona documentation.
- **Estimated Effort:** [Optional]

**Task LOS-S1-002-b: Perform Initial Data Source Test & Document Findings (Phase 2)**
- **Objective:** To perform a small-scale test run of the documented data gathering process using 1-2 key free data sources to validate the process and tool accessibility based on the existing target profile.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - At least 10-15 potential prospects matching the existing Target Profile identified using the process from LOS-S1-001-b and 1-2 free sources (e.g., Google Maps, one specific online directory).
    - Identified prospects entered into the Airtable CRM according to the documented process.
    - Notes on process efficiency, data source quality/yield, and any issues encountered documented within the relevant section of `outreach-playbook.md` or Airtable notes.
    - Airtable views/dashboards (LOS-004-b) checked for correct data population.
- **Dependencies:** LOS-002-b, LOS-004-b (Airtable Views/Dashboards), LOS-005-b (Tool Access), LOS-S1-001-b (Process Documented)
- **Relevant Resources:** Airtable CRM, selected free data sources, `outreach-playbook.md`, Existing Target Profile/Persona documentation.
- **Estimated Effort:** [Optional]

## Task Dependencies Graph:
- LOS-S1-002-b depends on LOS-S1-001-b (and implicitly on several scaffolding tasks: LOS-002-b, LOS-004-b, LOS-005-b)

## Verification Checkpoints:
- After LOS-S1-001-b: Data gathering process is documented in the playbook, referencing existing profiles/personas.
- After LOS-S1-002-b: Initial prospect data matching the profile exists in Airtable, process validation notes documented.
