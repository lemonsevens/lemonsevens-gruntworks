# Implementation Steps for Task LOS-003-b: Create Initial Strategy Playbook Document Structure

1.  Define Playbook Structure: Prepare the Markdown content for the new file, including a title and the 6 phase headings identified in `architecture.md` (Target Profile & Segmentation, Prospect ID & List Building, Outreach Playbook & Tactics, Engagement & Pitching, Execution Workflow & Tracking, Measurement & Refinement), each with brief placeholder text.
2.  Create Playbook File: Use the `edit_file` tool to create the new file `sales/landscaping-outreach-strategy/outreach-playbook.md` and populate it with the content defined in Step 1.
3.  Verify File Creation: Check the response from the `edit_file` tool to confirm the file was created successfully with the correct structure.
