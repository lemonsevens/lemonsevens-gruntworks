# Scaffolding Sprint Stories/Tasks for Landscaping Outreach Strategy

This document outlines the initial setup tasks (Sprint 0) required to establish the foundation for developing and executing the Landscaping Outreach Strategy.

## Tasks

**Task LOS-001-b: Integrate Strategy Development Tracking into Airtable Kanban**
- **Objective:** To ensure the tasks required for developing this Landscaping Outreach Strategy are properly represented and tracked within the existing Airtable Projects/Tasks Kanban system.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - A new Project/Epic entry created in the relevant Airtable base/table representing the "Landscaping Outreach Strategy Development".
    - This set of initial scaffolding tasks (LOS-001-b to LOS-006-b) entered as individual tasks under the new project/epic within Airtable.
    - Kanban view in Airtable correctly displays these initial tasks (e.g., in a 'To Do' or 'Backlog' status).
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Notes:** This leverages your existing Kanban workflow for tracking the *creation* of the strategy.

**Task LOS-002-b: Verify and Configure Airtable CRM for Landscaping Outreach**
- **Objective:** To confirm the existing Airtable CRM base (with Contacts, Accounts tables) is suitable and to add/verify necessary fields for tracking specific data points related to this outreach strategy.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Relevant Airtable Base ID identified and confirmed.
    - Existing `Contacts` and `Accounts` tables reviewed.
    - Necessary fields verified or added to `Accounts` table (e.g., 'Target Profile Match Status', 'Region', 'Company Size Est.', 'Data Source Notes').
    - Necessary fields verified or added to `Contacts` table (e.g., 'Decision Maker Role', 'Outreach Status', 'Last Tactic Used', 'Best Contact Method', 'Gatekeeper Notes').
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Notes:** Ensures your existing CRM structure can hold the specific data needed for this strategy's execution and measurement, as outlined in `architecture.md`.

**Task LOS-003-b: Create Initial Strategy Playbook Document Structure**
- **Objective:** To create the main Markdown document that will serve as the central playbook and populate it with the core structure defined in the architecture.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - New Markdown file created (e.g., `sales/landscaping-outreach-strategy/outreach-playbook.md`).
    - File contains the main section headings corresponding to the 6 phases defined in `architecture.md`.
    - Brief placeholder text under each heading indicates its purpose.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Notes:** This establishes the skeleton of the primary strategy document.

**Task LOS-004-b: Configure Airtable Views/Interfaces for KPI Tracking**
- **Objective:** To create specific views or interfaces within the existing Airtable CRM base to visualize the core Success Metrics/KPIs identified in the architecture document, filtered for this specific outreach strategy if necessary.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Specific Airtable Views created within the `Contacts`/`Accounts` tables to track key stages (e.g., "Prospects Identified", "Outreach Attempted", "Meeting Scheduled").
    - An Airtable Interface (dashboard) configured to display charts/summaries for key KPIs (e.g., Contact Rate, Meeting Set Rate - pulling data from the configured views).
- **Dependencies:** LOS-002-b
- **Notes:** Leverages Airtable's features for reporting, tailored to the KPIs in `architecture.md`.

**Task LOS-005-b: Establish Access/Accounts for Primary Data Sources & Tools**
- **Objective:** To ensure access is set up for the core external resources needed for prospect identification and outreach execution, beyond the core Airtable system.
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Accounts/logins created or verified for key free online directories mentioned in `resource-plan.md`.
    - Trial accounts created or preliminary access established for chosen Web Scraping tool (if applicable).
    - Trial accounts created or preliminary access established for chosen Data Enrichment tool (if applicable).
    - Account setup initiated or vendor contact made for chosen Direct Mail service (if applicable).
- **Dependencies:** None (Can run in parallel)
- **Notes:** Focuses on the *external* tools supporting the strategy.

**Task LOS-006-b: Define Evaluation Process for Paid Resources**
- **Objective:** To document the process, criteria, and budget considerations for deciding on and purchasing lead lists or subscribing to premium versions of tools (scrapers, enrichment).
- **Key Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Simple decision framework documented (e.g., criteria for evaluating list providers, minimum data quality thresholds).
    - Budget approval process outlined.
    - Added as a section or appendix within the main `outreach-playbook.md` (LOS-003-b).
- **Dependencies:** LOS-003-b (for adding the documentation)
- **Notes:** Ensures a structured approach before spending money on potentially variable-quality resources.

## Task Dependencies Graph:
- LOS-004-b depends on LOS-002-b
- LOS-006-b depends on LOS-003-b
- LOS-001-b, LOS-002-b, LOS-003-b, LOS-005-b have no dependencies within this set.

## Verification Checkpoints:
- After LOS-001-b: Strategy development project and these tasks are visible and trackable in Airtable Kanban.
- After LOS-002-b: Necessary fields for tracking landscaping outreach exist in Airtable Contacts/Accounts tables.
- After LOS-003-b: `outreach-playbook.md` file exists with phase headings.
- After LOS-004-b: Specific Airtable views and a basic KPI dashboard/interface exist for monitoring this strategy.
- After LOS-005-b: Access to key external tools/sources (non-Airtable) is confirmed.
- After LOS-006-b: Process document/section for evaluating paid resources exists within the playbook.
