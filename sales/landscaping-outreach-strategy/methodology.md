# Selected Project Methodology

## Methodology
- **Name:** Kanban (Agile)
- **Specifics/Framework:** Standard Kanban practices with simple workflow visualization (e.g., columns like Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done). Focus on continuous flow and limiting work-in-progress as needed.

## Rationale
- Chosen based on project characteristics:
    - Flexibility: High
    - Team Structure: Single Person
    - Delivery Cadence: Incremental
    - Client Involvement (Internal Stakeholders): Low
- Aligns with project goals by enabling:
    - High adaptability to evolving outreach tactics and research findings.
    - Continuous, incremental development and refinement of the strategy document/playbook.
    - Clear workflow visualization for a single person to manage tasks effectively.

## Key Practices Overview
- **Visualize Workflow:** Use a board (physical or digital) with columns representing stages of work.
- **Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP):** (Optional but recommended) Set limits on the number of tasks allowed in 'In Progress' stages to maintain focus and flow.
- **Manage Flow:** Focus on moving tasks smoothly through the workflow from start to finish.
