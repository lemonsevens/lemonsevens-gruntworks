## Integration/Alignment Notes
The supporting resources primarily serve as inputs (data sources, research methods) or conceptual frameworks (tactic categories) for the content that will be documented using the Core Resource (Markdown editor). The playbook created will detail *how* to use these supporting resources effectively.

## Specification Rationale (if applicable)
- Markdown (`.md`) was chosen for the core documentation resource for simplicity, version control compatibility, and consistency.
- Specific versions for external databases or tools (like B2B databases or email verifiers) are generally not fixed in a plan, as the latest available/subscribed version is typically used. The *methods* for using them are documented in the playbook.
